5,"This was DELICIOUS!!!! Meatballs were super tender spices were perfect, nice and savory. Gravy was very good (I&apos;m going to try less sour cream next time but I like a meatier gravy) I made the gravy with the dripping like it called for but I used the pan I fried meatballs in earlier which had even more drippy goodness in it. I served the meatballs over rice but I might try noodles sometime. A word of caution, try to pace yourself while eating these it&apos;s easy to inhale a couple dozen and these deserve to be savored!"
5,This dish was perfect. I wanted to try it as my grandmother used to make Swedeish Meatballs at Christmas times as well. The flavor is perfect and the gravy outstanding. Thank you for helping me create the same memories with my children. Thank you for sharing the recipe. The entire family loved it and my children will usally avoid anything with onions. They went back for seconds on this fabulous dish.
5,"This is oh so good. I did a search online for the Swedish Name version. Tried some. This is by far the tastiest! After everything was done, I put in slow cooker on warm. Added noodles way al dente. When we were ready to eat, every taste blended wonderfully."
5,"I usually hate it when when people rate recipes that they don&apos;t follow, but I&apos;m guilty this time.  I skipped the meatballs and used beef stew meat.  Browned it off and threw it in the crockpot with all of your spices (including the optionals).  When the meat was tender, I thickend the sauce, added the sour cream and served over fresh pasta. Absolutely delicious!  I guess my version could be called Swedish stroganoff?  Very good recipe.  I will make the meat balls next time to honor your family tradition."
5,"Definitely 5 stars!!!  I was hesitant to use what Americans call ""baking spices"" with meat but I&apos;m so glad I tried this (including the ginger).  The spices are perfectly blended and very subtle. I served it over egg noodles which works great with the gravy & meatballs. I would be very proud to serve this to dinner guests.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 lb ground beef & 1/2 lb ground pork instead of the 2/3 & 1/3 ratio in the recipe (just for practicality -- I will be making this again soon!)"
4,"Nice tender meatball. I had my grandmothers swedish meatball in mind when I tried this.....but this doesn&apos;t have enough seasoning for my taste. Otherwise, lovely and simple but I would zap up the nutmeg and allspice a tiny bit. My grandmother used to put a tiny bit of the allspice in the gravy too. I also served this with tiny yellow potatoes, lingonberries and carrots and brussel sprouts. Very nice combo. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe Nom Nom Nom :)"
4,"Hubs and I really enjoyed this tonight but I have to agree with the ""most  helpful"" reviewer - this was a tad too ""sour creamy,"" so if I had it to do over again, I, too, would like a meatier gravy and reduce the amount of sour cream.  Also, looking at the mix of ingredients it seemed to me that it would produce a really  ""wet"" mixture.  I decided to hold off adding the chicken broth and I&apos;m glad I did as the texture and consistency was just right without it.  Had I used it, I&apos;m afraid it might have been too loose, making it more difficult to form the meatballs.  I did add the optional ginger.  Glad I did that too.  I formed the mixture into approximately 1"" meatballs, and these required  only about 18 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees.   I used butter in place of the drippings for the roux.  The sour cream was different for me - I generally use heavy cream.  Wasn&apos;t sure I would like it as much, but not to worry, other than there being a little too much of it, we liked it nearly as well as we do when made with cream.  All and all, a good recipe - just needs some tweaking, I think, to perfect it to suit individual tastes and preferences."
4,"I only made the meatballs from this recipe, not the gravy.  I also used groung turkey rather than beef & pork.  That said, it&apos;s the spices that really make this recipe.  I was afraid the meatballs would taste ""odd"" using spices usully reserved for baked goods, but it&apos;s actually really good.  After baking the meatballs, I put them in a covered casserole with a can of cream of chicken & a can of cream of mushroom soup with some milk to make a gravy.  I baked them for about 40 minutes & then served over egg noodles.  Yum!"
5,"Yuuuummmm! This was so good - it vaguely reminds me of the Swedish meatballs my mother used to make whenever there was a party. I didn&apos;t have time for ""day-old"" bread so I lightly toasted two slices and crumbled those with the cream. Also I used a bit more meat (closer to 1 lb. of beef 1/2 lb. of pork) but otherwise everything else was the same. I recommend using all the spices incl. the brown sugar and ginger. They blend beautifully and the taste is subtle and delicious. Great recipe; thanks to NomNomNom for posting!"
2,"I followed recipe exactly like written... 
                                 I thought it was over the top sweet, almost like eating a cupcake. I think there were errors in cooking time, it took me well over 2 hours to make this and I am not an amatuer cook. I also think that if you try this recipe, do not add the sour cream to the simmered sauce unless you temper the sour cream or it can curdle. I&apos;m sorry but very disapointed in this recipe. I only gave it a two star beccause the meatball was tender and moist which is always nice. Just thought too much went into this"
5,"This cheesecake turned out great!  The changes I made was to add one cup of eggnog & an extra tablespoon of rum.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust.  I wrapped the bottom of the springform pan with foil and baked it in a water-filled cookie pan.  I baked it for the time specified and it came out perfect with no cracks.  I followed what someone else said and I beat 1 cup whipping cream with 3 T powdered sugar and then I added 1 tsp. rum extract & 1 tsp. cinnamon.  It really added to the eggnog flavor.  Also, I microwaved the cream cheese and eggnog just until it was at room temp. and I mixed everything with my kitchenaid stand mixer and this worked very well.  I&apos;ll definitely be making this every year for the holidays!"
5,"This cheesecake is FANTASTIC. I used helpful suggestions from the other reviewers to make modifications, and here&apos;s my advice:
                                1. I scaled the recipe down to 11 servings so it used 2 pkgs of cream cheese. I used one pkg of full-fat cream cheese and one pkg of light, and it still tasted wonderfully rich. 
                                3. I added about 3/4 to 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter, subbed 3/4 tbsp of vanilla extract for the rum (I didn&apos;t have any rum on hand), and used 1 cup eggnog. 
                                4. MAKE THIS CHEESECAKE THE DAY BEFORE YOU NEED IT (I can&apos;t stress that enough; this recipe improves with time, and the flavor is much better the second day). 
                                5. If you&apos;re using a store-bought graham cracker crust, there will be more batter than you need to fill the crust, so look up a ""crustless cheesecake"" recipe and use those directions for baking the excess batter. 
                                6. Use a water bath (I just filled a cake pan with water and put it on the bottom rack of the oven, below the middle rack where the cheesecake was).
                                7. When it&apos;s finished cooking, turn off the heat, open the oven door a bit, and let it cool in there for a couple hours before refrigerating.
                                
                                This recipe is fantastic - it&apos;s definitely going to be an Xmas staple from now on!"
5,"Excellent cheesecake! A great way to use leftover eggnog. I didn&apos;t have any rum, so I used vanilla extract instead - it still tasted as if alcohol had been added to it (DELICIOUS!). Since I didn&apos;t have a food processor big enough to fit the entire recipe, I used an electric beater. I made sure to beat the cream cheese mixture until very fluffy. It was so fluffy that I thought it would colapse after removing from the oven. To my surprise, it didn&apos;t. And, to give it a delicate flavor, I used crushed lady fingers in place of graham crakers. The final result was of a very light and creamy filling over a delicious crust. Perfect for making mini-sized cheesecakes (the kind that you can eat in 2 to 3 bites); a great addition to the finger-food menu of an elegant party."
5,"This may be the best cheesecake I&apos;ve ever made.  I brought this to our work holiday party and EVERYONE raved about it.  Not too sweet, great eggnog flavor.  I did a gingersnap crust instead of graham cracker and that complemented the nutmeg and eggnog beautifully and substituted vanilla extract for the rum.  It was very easy to make and the biggest hit I&apos;ve had at a potluck since I made chocolate bread pudding 4 years ago.  Definitely a keeper for holiday desserts."
5,"This is the most delicious cheesecake I&apos;ve ever had.  I&apos;ve made dozens of them, and people have started hiring me to bake them for their Christmas parties this year.  It always comes out perfectly, and is always a hit.  I use my KitchenAid mixer and let it mix for a good, long while until everything is smooth and creamy.  This recipe is to die for!"
5,"I made these cheesecake THREE times during December--that&apos;s how good it is. Here are my modifications: (1) use gingersnaps for the crust. Every time I made it someone raved about the crust. (2) Use 1 c. of eggnog not 3/4 c. Someone else recommended this and it works. Use more nutmeg than a pinch. (3) Use spiced rum if you have it. And finally when the recipe says ""remove from oven and immediately loosen sides "" do it. The first time I did not and it cracked heavily as it cooled. I spread whipped cream over the top and no one ever knew. But the next time I ran a knife around the sides and it didn&apos;t crack at all. Best if you can let it sit overnight. Easy and absolutely great for holiday desserts."
5,This cheesecake had a great consistancy - not too heavy yet satisfying in the way only cheesecake can be. I used the Pecan Caramel sauce from Eggnog Cheesecake I at this site - it has dark rum in it and was perfect. I also added some spices ( 1/4 tsp each of ginger nutmeg and cinnamon) to the crust. I don&apos;t have a food processor I just mixed the heck out of it with my stand mixer.
5,"SO good!  The perfect elegant, yet not too challenging holiday dessert.  I had plenty of eggnog leftover from making my yearly eggnog Christmas cookies and wanted to make a cheesecake for a family Christmas celebration, so it made perfect sense.
                                
                                I followed several different suggestions and made some minor adjustments to the original recipe.  I will admit, that although I&apos;ve made enough cheesecakes that I would say I&apos;m a fairly experienced cheesecake baker I have never prepared my batter in a food processor so I was a little nervous but since I already had the processor out to make my crust I thought I&apos;d give it a go, and it worked out great, plus I didn&apos;t dirty up my mixer!  
                                
                                The changes I made are as follows:
                                - for the crust I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg
                                - I upped the eggnog to 1 cup in the batter
                                - replaced the rum with 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
                                - added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg  to batter
                                
                                Also, unlike many of the users I did not use a waterbath, nor have I ever.  The consistency was great and no cracks!"
4,"When I set out to find an unusual holiday cheesecake recipe, I stumbled upon this one, which seemed like one of the easiest. Not only was it relatively easy, it was one of the smoothest, richest cheesecakes I&apos;ve ever tasted. The eggnog flavor lends itself very well to this classic dessert. In addition to an eggnog cheesecake, I used the basic recipe but substituted pure almond flavor for the rum and then swirled it with freshly grated ginger before baking. Both were superlative. Thanks for the great recipe."
3,I was really excited to try and make this and read all the reviews/suggestions before I made it. Next time I will bake it a little longer and I won t use rum extract but vanilla extract and cinnamon.
5,This was a yummy recipe!! Some small changes though little more than 3/4 molasses not 1 cup 1 Tbsp cinnamon (says 1 tsp) and 1 tsp of all spice. Those spices really kicked up the flavor. Also make sure to use lots of flour to roll out the dough as it is sticky.
5,"I was apprehensive, with the variety of reviews, but this recipe turned out great.  I&apos;ve made gingerbread cookies in the past; either the dough was too tough to work with, or they did taste like cardboard after baking (the frosting redeemed them).  I did double the ginger, as suggested.  The dough was soft, easy to work with, and did not get hard and tough as we continued to work with it. The dough we were working with mixed very well with the dough we added from the refrigerator. The cookies were  soft when done baking.  The kids and I both liked the flavor.  I will use this recipe again."
5,I doubled the cinnamon left the ginger the same (a whole tablespoon is plenty) and cut the molasses to 34 cup. They came out tasting great:) I also dumped the cloves because I don&apos;t like that flavor. The dough wasn&apos;t the easiest to work with but I didn&apos;t wait the full three hours to roll it out so I can&apos;t complain. The cookies held their shape in the oven and stayed soft in the middle. Another minute or two would have added some crispiness and I&apos;ll probably try that next time. Great cookies thanks for the recipe:)
1,Recipe was easy to follow dough looked great but compared to the genuine swedish recipe this was not good. I can not believe anyone ever got a compliment on these cookies. Usually the dough is great to taste too but this i could not even take a tiny bite. I decided to make them anyway thinking maybe when they are cooked they would taste better. I ended up throwing them all away! Tomorrow I am calling my mother for her recipe!
5,Excellent soft gingerbread cookies. I have received many compliments!! I must have been using potent powdered ginger: unlike other reviewers I found my cookies to have a hot ginger taste. As suggested by others I doubled the cinnamon & added 1/2 tsp allspice. Next time I would leave the cinnamon at 1 tsp to keep the ginger dominant. I used 1/2 cup shortening (all I had on hand) and 1/2 cup margarine. I did not notice a &apos;molasses taste&apos;. I recommend rolling the dough out between 2 pieces of plastic wrap rather than using a floured surface to reduce the risk of dry cookies. Bake only until the cookies don&apos;t look wet. They will be sturdy but still soft when cool.
1,"I hate giving a bad review to a favorite recipe of another but these tasted awful and I was extremely dissapointed. The shortening taste is more pronounced than it should be and the taste of molasses and cloves is overwhelming. For the cost of the spices and the time it takes to work the dough together this recipe was a huge let down (my son and I had planned on decorating gingerbread men and had all the fixings to do so - we decided to make another dessert after tasting the cookie) I would choose a recipe with a ""sweeter"" base. These are spicy but not in a way that will be pleasing to children and I have to agree with another reviewes when they said these tasted like dog biscuits. Sorry!!"
5,"Delectable.  Use only 3/4 cup molasses, it&apos;s enough.  You want these sweet and spicy, not too molasses-rich."
5,Reading some of the other reviews I almost decided not to try these. But I&apos;m sooooo glad that I did. I didn&apos;t change anything and they were great. I baked them only until they were slightly firm to the touch. Perfect. Thanks Kim.
5,Fantastic! My kids as well as the adults in the family loved this cookie. If they come out too dry try cooking them for a minute or so less. The dough was easy to make at the end it got a little difficult for mixing but once the dry ingredients were all absorbed it was a dream! Give it a taste test before you divide it up for the fridge. This was a really nice cookie I will make it every year! Thanks Kim!
5,"This recipe is the perfect base for any hot artichoke dip. Make it just the way it is 1-1-1 or mix it up with some chopped jalepenos, spinach, green peppers or roasted garlic. Depending on the crowd I serve it to, I adjust it accordingly. The only downfall, there&apos;s never enough. When making for a crowd make a quadruple batch at least. It even works in the crock pot."
3,"Very tasty. Would add a 1/2-tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and maybe some Worsteshire sauce. Make sure to rinse the artichoke hearts, otherwise fishy taste occurs. Also, bake a few more minutes for extra golden top."
5,I&apos;ve been making this dip for years also. It&apos;s one of my favorites. I add a sprinkle of garlic salt and definitely use Hellman&apos;s. Once time for a change I decided to spread the dip on a Boboli&apos; crust and bake it. I cut it up into small slices. Yummy!
5,My mom used to make this and I forgot how good it was until I came across the recipe here and made it over the holidays. No one I&apos;ve served it to believes it&apos;s only 3 ingredients. I find that it&apos;s easiest to chop the artichokes in the food processor. I also like to mix all the ingredients and let it chill over night so the flavors can blend. It also comes out best if you use freshly grated or &apos;premium&apos; (found in your grocer&apos;s deli case or cheese case) parmesan rather than the stuff in a can. I also recommend using Hellmann&apos;s mayo for the best results. Thanks for reminding me what a simple but great recipe this is.
5,"Fabulous dip and totally idiot proof! SO simple and so good....this is one of my ""go to"" recipes when we have company. It turns out best when you use Hellman&apos;s mayo....don&apos;t use the light mayo it doesn&apos;t work as well! I also throw in a couple of minced garlic cloves."
5,I frequently make this artichoke dip recipe with the addition of fresh chopped garlic. Fantastic baked as a dip but also quite delicious when spooned into mini phyllo cups and baked until bubbly rave reviews.
4,GREAT AND EASY RECIPE!! JUST DONT FORGET TO ADD LEMON JUICE....IVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS NOW BUT ALWAYS ADD THE LEMON JUICE IT KICKS IT UP A NOTCH. BIG HIT AT ALL MY PARTIES!!!!! have fun!
5,Great with a small can of green chiles added.
5,Thank you. I finally found my favorite dip from years past. This is the best dip goes well with a toasted bagel or vegies or any dip friendly foods. Yes it&apos;s true you can&apos;t use generic mayo. I think Helmans or Kraft brand mayo works best.
5,"If light corn syrup is not available, you can substitute a sugar syrup made with 1-1/4 cups sugar and 1/3 cup water, boiled together until syrupy."
5,"Absolutely fabulous sugar cookie icing!  This icing recipe is the ""Holy Grail"" of icing.  I have been searching for an icing recipe that allows me to bake cookies that look like they were purchased from a designer cookie shop. Thanks to this recipe, my search is over! I&apos;ve made this icing several times and it has never let me down!  The icing sets up shiny and beautiful and the colors are so bright and glossy.  I use the paste food colorings--that you can purchase at any craft store.  The icing appears ""wet"", but it sets up nicely and you are able to stack the cookies.  However, the icing isn&apos;t too hard.  It&apos;s perfect.  I&apos;ve used this icing to make decorated butterfly cookies that most people thought I purchased at a bakery.  I also made heart cookies for Valentine&apos;s day.  I packaged them in individual cellophane bags and tied with a ribbon--a cute, inexpensive treat for friends and my children&apos;s friends.  This icing&apos;s consistency is wonderful, too.  I spoon it on cookies and work it around the shape.  I use a paintbrush to add details, and the end of the paintbrush to add dots.  And yes, I do add additional milk--a 1/2 tsp at a time.  It&apos;s not a problem though.  I add small amounts of milk until I get the right constistency.  I can&apos;t say enough about this icing and how it has helped me to make gorgeous, professional-looking cookies for all occassions!"
5,"This worked great for me! I put the 1 cup of confectioner&apos;s sugar in the bowl, added 4 tsp of milk all at once and stirred it until evenly mixed. Then I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract (I know it only calls for 1/4 tsp, but you can never use too much vanilla extract) and stirred again until all mixed. Then I added a tablespoon of corn syrup and stirred until evenly mixed. At that point it was the perfect consistency for spreading and drizzling, and perfectly smooth. I tried using gel color to color it and that worked really well, but with another batch I just used regular food coloring and that worked just fine too.
                                
                                It dried very quickly, within 20 minutes I was able to add a second drizzle coat (of another color) without it sinking into the first coat. It took about 90 minutes to dry hard. I had no problem, using a single batch of this icing recipe,  covering a 40-cookie batch of sugar cookies (average size 2"" by 1.5"") with a solid coat and a drizzle coat, and there was still some icing left over. 
                                
                                Will be using this one again and again! :)"
5,"This icing is the best! I used lemon flavoring and it tasted great. The trick that worked for me in making this icing was add the 2 tsp. of milk to a bowl and then slowly stir in the powdered sugar a little at a time. It will come out smooth like the recipe says. You just have to be patient. Then add your corn syrup, flavoring and color."
5,"You have to  play around with the milk and corn syrup pretty much, but it&apos;s best to start with what the recipe calls for and add to desired consistency.  This recipe was great.  The glaze does take time to dry - overnight is best.  But the colors don&apos;t fade and the icing dries shiny, but not too hard.  I made this icing using both almond and lemon extract with superb results for both.  The icing adds that big of extra flavor to boring old sugar cookie recipes but the flavor isn&apos;t overbearing.  Cookies come out stackable and easy to transport after drying.  
                                
                                This was my first time ever making decorated cookies and the person who received my cookie gifts asked me if I&apos;d purchased them at a bakery!  So I was very pleased with this recipe and will probably use it forever!"
5,"** 5 STARS! ** FABULOUS! I used this icing on my gingerbread men instead of Royal Icing because it requires egg whites.  I added vanilla extract instead of almond extract. Placed it in sandwich bags, snip the corner, & piped it on the gingerbread men.  NICE!!"
5,It&apos;s easy and makes for a nice professional shiny and smooth finish. It&apos;s a very sweet icing but aren&apos;t they all?  I did have to add a bit more milk and corn syrup to make it into a spreadable consistancy.  Make sure you don&apos;t add too much of either ... otherwise it gets too runny. I used the almond extract as suggested but have also substituted it with clear vanilla and lemon extract. I think any extract will work. It takes a few of hours to harden and is stackable after that. I used a thin layer of this icing with the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies Recipe.  This made a thick professional looking cookie.
4,Great basic recipe for beautiful colorful glossy frosting. I have to work at it each time to get the right consistency. Tip: add a little more milk to make it thinner and easier to brush onto the cookies (if you are getting artistic like I do). Adding more syrup will not allow it to dry and it will stay gooey until you eat them! I use frosting food colors from the cake decorating section of my craft store they work great.
5,I adjusted the recipe with the amount of milk and corn syrup to get it to the consistency I liked (about 3 tsp of milk and 3 tsp of corn syrup).  The icing tasted and looked good and was pretty easy to work with.  I used this on the Soft Christmas Cookies by Georgie Bowers.  I will use this again.
2,I did not care for this because of the flavor. Sure did look nice on the cookies though.
5,"I&apos;ve made these many times and everyone loves them. They are not time consuming at all and can be made up two days before needed. Wash mushrooms and twist out stems. Drain in colander. Put mushroom caps on paper towels to drain well. Slice off woody part of stem and put in food processor. Pulse stems until minced. Add 1 Tlbs olive oil to pan and stir-fry minced stems and garlic (minced type from jar)until dry. Add spices. Slightly cool, but while still warm add  cheeses (and a can of drained crab if want). Put a plastic zip lock bag into a bowl and roll back sides- add cream cheese mixture. Snip off one corner and use as a pastry bag to fill mushrooms. If making ahead 1)use only freshest mushrooms you can find, 2)blot off excess water from mushrooms, 3)put them into a non-metalic dish. I sprinkle the tops with shreded (not grated )parmesan cheese. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrig. until ready to bake. (I&apos;ve made up to two days in advance- without crabmeat though)."
5,"This is a favorite recipe that I have made several times and I never have any leftovers.  Even my young son loves the flavorfull filling. These are great to bring to get togethers.  I usually prepare the stuffing and put into a ziplock and assemble them when I arrive.  Just snip off the corner of the ziplock, fill the mushrooms like a pastry and pop in the oven. Adjustments I make are I add crabmeat to the mixture which I find adds a little more substance to an otherwise very creamy filling.  I like to sprinkle with parmesan cheese before putting them in the oven which adds a nice touch.  A trick I use is to use smaller mushrooms so there is a good balance between mushroom and the amount of filling.  I tried larger ones one time and it almost seemed like each bite was just a bit too full of creamy mixture.  I also lightly butter the mushrooms before baking which keeps them from drying out.  Last trick is I bake them in mini muffin tin pans.  They hold the smaller mushrooms perfectly and the pans keep the mushrooms from tipping over and rolling around.  The cayenne pepper gives just the perfect amount of kick to this recipe."
5,"Great! A little time consuming, but worth it. I, too, added some chopped green onion while sauteeing and lightly brushed outside of mushrooms with melted butter laced with Ital. crumbs. Made almost 3 doz. reg. mushrooms! TIP: slice off bottem a little so they don&apos;t roll over."
5,"Wow, these are ever so good exactly as written!!!  For my family&apos;s personal preference, I added the following....  16 oz of ground sausage, increased the Parmesan to 1/2 cup and the garlic to 1.5 tbsp, and then rolled the top of the stuffed mushrooms in the Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs prior to baking.  Created a great little crunch with wonderful oozy goodness underneath.  Absolutely divine!!!"
3,"I made for Christmas dinner appetizer and they were YUMMY! But i also read a lot of the reviews and took some of the advice (and left some). I rated accordingly since i changed it a bit. I used 12 large mushrooms (caps about 2"" wide) as the recipe called for as well as the the whole pkg of cream cheese and it was just right. Next time, though, I will use bite size smaller mushrooms but double the amount of mushrooms to make it easier to eat as a appetizer. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and  added to the original ingredients for the filling: 2 stalks green onions (minced and cooked with the garlic and mushroom stems), a bit more parmesan (used fresh grated parmesano reggiano), a bit of garlic powder, 1 crisp, crumbled bacon and about a cup of cooked dungeoness crab. I dunked the mushroom caps in melted butter & lemon before filling, sprinkled with more parmesan and baked in a mini muffin pan. (Beware: if the mushrooms don&apos;t fit all the way into the muffin pan, they will come out shaped like muffins! It is kind of cute though.) Cooked for 20 mins and they came out beautifully! Everyone loved them! The parmesan topping gave it that extra crunch too! And love the heat the Cayenne leaves after you eat it. Will make (my new revised recipe again!) Thanks!"
5,This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms and after reading several of the reviews I decided on how I would make mine. The full amount of cream cheese was enough for 24 mushrooms and I placed a bit of chopped proscuitto in the bottom of each mushroom before placing the cheese mixture on top (which was wonderful). I then sprinkled garlic and herb bread crumbs over them and drizzled melted butter over all. Baked for only 15 minutes and broiled for the last 5. They were wonderful. I plan on making these when my Mom and Grandmom come to visit in the fall. Thanks a bunch!
5,"Excellent recipe.  I doubled the filling and used 24 oz fresh mushrooms and it filled them almost perfectly.  I also added  a dash of Worcestershire sauce while cooking the stems and 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon to the cream cheese mixture.  Just before baking, I sprinkled with breadcrumbs and dipped the mushroom caps in melted butter so that they wouldn&apos;t dry out.  I brought to Thanksgiving as an appetizer and they went in minutes.  Everyone loved the bite that the cayenne pepper added.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
5,"I have made these many times, and they always disappear so fast!  What a great recipe.  I put the stuffing into a ziploc bag with a corner cut off and squeeze it into the caps, it&apos;s less messy.  Thanks for sharing such a great treat!"
5,"Very good recipe! My husband gave it 2 thumbs up, which is HUGE. I followed some other reviewers&apos; suggestions and added 1/4 cup or seasoned breadcrumbs, and cut the cream cheese to about 2/3 what the recipe called for. I also used 2 10oz pkgs of white mushrooms, or about double what the recipe specified. I&apos;m sure adding crabmeat would&apos;ve made it even better, but i don&apos;t think it needs it... i kept the recipe cheap, quick, and easy!"
5,The best instructions ever. I used fresh parmesan reggiano and parsley. Delicious!!!
5,"This looks great, can&apos;t wait to try it.
                                
                                But, 14? Really? 14? Not 12?"
5,"After making the dough instead of using a cookie press or dropping by balls, I rolled the dough into four logs, wrapped the logs in waxed paper, placed in the fridge to harden, and then sliced in about 1/2"" slices. Perfect and delicious. Sometimes I make the dough up to 3 days ahead of time then slice and bake when I need them. After baked I sprinkle with powder sugar. Makes a beauiful presentation."
5,"Excellent shortbread ccokies!! But be prepared when making these, the recipe says it makes 2 dozen and that&apos;s WAY off unless you&apos;re using some super **huge** cookie press! I get at least 6 dozen cookies out of one batch every time I make them!"
5,"these cookies were fantastic!! i rolled out the dough and used cutters.. turned out fantastic.. also have sprinkled with sugar, and others i drizzled with chocolate.. great recipe, you gotta try it.."
5,"This recipe was very easy and came out very good.  But I think the proportions are wrong, I halved the recipe and still made at least 2 dozen.  I also didn&apos;t have a cookie press, so I just rolled the dough into little balls, then flattened them on the cookie sheet.  Next time I plan on dipping them in melted chocolate... mmmm.."
5,Wonderful shortbread cookie! These were so easy to make and yet turned out fabulous. It&apos;s great when such simple ingredients come together to create something so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough chill in the fridge for a half hour before rolling it out and using cookie cutters vs. a cookie press. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!
5,"I made a second batch using ""orange"" extract instead of the vanilla.  They were fabulous!"
3,I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don&apos;t have is a cookie press. I&apos;m a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn&apos;t even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface.   I&apos;m sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn&apos;t want it to go to waste. We&apos;ll see how they bake!  Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It&apos;s also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.
4,"This is the first time I&apos;ve actually bothered to log in and write a review. Oh man, these cookies are good. Yes, you should add a little confectioner&apos;s sugar to improve the taste and add to the ""melt in your mouth"" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don&apos;t even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I&apos;d bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn&apos;t use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you&apos;re having a cookie craving, give these a try. YUM!!"
4,"They really do melt in your mouth.  I was surprised that so few ingredients made such a tasty little cookie. This was my first try with a cookie press and this recipe worked wonderfully, even though the directions that came with the press said to use only their recipe."
4,"I made a few change to this recipe as well. I have made Mexican Wedding Cookies for more than half my life. It was taught to me by my Auntie Nacia when I was in high school. I use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. I have used one teaspoon vanilla extract, real not imitation, and one teaspoon almond extract. You can also flavor these cookies with rum, frangelico, kahlua, or any of your favorite spipping spirits. Sift your sugar and your flour to make your cookie dough light in texture, before and after baking."
5,"I love this cookie recipe.  It is quick and simple, and great for any occasion.  I used 3/4 c. chopped pecans (the small package of chopped pecans found in the cake mix aisle at the grocery store) instead of almonds.  I only chilled my cookie dough 1 1/2 hrs.  They were delicious!  They had great flavor and did not crumble or fall apart when baked.  This is an overall great cookie recipe."
5,"This was my first shot at making wedding cookies.  Although I used pecans instead of almond, these were/are excellent!!  I even received raved review from the girls I work with.  Thank you for such a yummy recipe.  I have to say that I have had wedding cookies in the past that were awful.  This is the perfect recipe!  Merry Christmas!  I made these again this year and they were still excellent.  I used pecans and walnut together and I only baked them for 8-10 minutes maybe because my cookies were smaller.  These are addicting!!"
5,These cookies were simple to make and would be simple enough for a child to make (w/ adult supervision). Commonly known as Russian Tea Cakes they are also referred to as Mexican Wedding cookies. I made the batch twice -once following the recipe the second making some subtle changes. Here are the changes I made. I swapped the regular sugar out and replaced w/ 10x confectioner sugar -this produced a smoother texture. I left out the water and added 1/4 tsp of salt. I reduced the amount of nuts to 3/4 cup and replaced the almonds with pecans. I also added 1 TBSP of vanilla caramel powdered dairy creamer to the powdered sugar when I rolled the cookies in it...and WOW is all I can say! The first batch was good (a 3.5 star rating) but I enjoyed the second batch better thus the five star rating
3,I couldn&apos;t get the powdered sugar to stick to the cookies after they had cooled...might try rolling them while still slightly warm.
4,These are great cookies; however I made a few changes. I used confectioners&apos; sugar instead of granulated white sugar sifted the flour and used pecans instead of almonds. They are like pecan sandies in confectioners&apos; sugar. I made them for my christmas cookie tins. I made them ball shaped and called them snowballs when anyone asked what they were.
5,I made this recipe for a Spanish project for the whole class. It turned out bsolutely amazing and everyone loved them. They&apos;re best if you put a ton of powdered sugar on them. They are also very easy to make. I have never baked in my life and they turned out great! It&apos;s a great recipe for a beginner.
4,"This was a great recipe! I did use chopped walnuts in place of the suggested nuts because I prefer a softer nut with these cookies I also used powder sugar in place of granulated because it does give it more of a ""melt in your mouth"" texture. Other than that it is a keeper in my holiday baking!"
4,my first recipe from allrecipes.com and it was great! i only gave it 4 stars because i made the following changes:chopped pecans instead of almonds 1/2 cup confectioners sugar instead of granulated and i didn&apos;t chill the dough for 3 hours. everyone raved about how tastey these cookies were!
5,"Yes, it is THAT good.  A nice chewy molasses cookie. EXCELLENT flavor.  When storing these (and other cookies) store a piece of bread with them to keep them moist, otherwise they dry out like rocks!  But these are exactly what you&apos;re looking for - easy, idiot-proof, and EXCELLENT.  MAKE THEM NOW!!!!!!"
5,Substituted butter for the margarine and brown sugar for the white.  They turned out fabulous.  The are the most consistent and uniform cookies I ever make. Tastes like a soft ginger snap. My husband requests them again and again!
5,"I have made these cookies about 15 times over the past few years and they always turn out great. I also use butter instead of margarine. After rolling in sugar and placing on baking sheet, I slightly flatten using a smooth bottomed glass.  Depending on my mood(and time) I will glaze with a simple home-made frosting.  Make sure to watch the timing on these cookies, it is critical."
4,very good however I took the advice of others and made some changes. Doubled the spices only 1tsp of baking soda and used brown sugar. I also dipped all the cookies in powered sugar after they were cooled and it was not only pretty but delicious!
5,This is my favorite cookie recipe I have found on this site. The spice is just right not too subtle not too strong. They are wonderfully soft. I have however made one change. I use one teaspoon baking soda instead of two. I thought the soda taste was too obvious and when I halved the amount they turned out perfect. I also found that if I just slightly softened the margarine instead of fully melting it I was able to skip the chill time.
5,I made them exactly except I used only 1 tsp of soda as suggested. Also since I don&apos;t like eggs I used egg substitute ( good for vegans!!) and they came out perfect. I creamed the sugar in softened NOT melted unsalted butter. The dough mixed nicely with the 2 cups of flour. I chilled the dough for a couple of hours which worked out well. My baking time was about 10 minutes in a gas oven @ 375 F. They cracked beautifully and the taste was chewy and soft with a slightly crisp top due to the sugar. I love them and will bring then to my holiday parties. I&apos;m keeping this recipe for future use.
4,"very tasty.  I Changed a few things.  I halfed the soda as suggested.  I also used brown sugar and butter instead of margerine and a splash of vanilla (you just can&apos;t bake without vanilla).  I cooked them for two different times.  They&apos;re prettier when you cook them till 7 minutes because of they crackle but 6 minutes makes a chewier cookie.  Next time I&apos;ll double the spices.  Thanks for a good recipe! My one year old thinks it&apos;s good too!!  PS Don&apos;t listen to the people who say that batter turns out runny, there&apos;s obviously something they missed in it.  The dough is lovely."
4,Nice flavor. Maybe it&apos;s my oven but these took less than 8 mins. I started taking them out at about 7 mins and the last sheet of cookies removed were actually burnt. Leave them in a ball when you bake and don&apos;t flatten them (like I did on some). They are better thick and chewy otherwise they are more crisp like a gingersnap.
5,"Every year my family has a ""bake off"" when we get together and bake cookies and give them out to friends for Christmas. But being the highly competitive people that we are we make it a contest. For the first time in 7 years of baking I won with these cookies in 2005. I was thrilled! I followed the recipe exactly since I&apos;m really not much of a baker. The results aren&apos;t in yet for 2006 bu so far I am in the lead with two recipes that I also got from this site. Thanks to Brenda and all the others who post thse wonderful recipes!"
3,I grind my own flour and found that I needed more than 2 cups of flour I ended up after baking a batch adding more flour and then they turned out great. In the future I will use 2 1/2 cups of flour. I did use butter as it is MUCH healthier than margarine (it&apos;s natural margarine is NOT) and also used brown sugar.
5,Oh my land!! This!
5,Soo good!! I will make it again! Thanks.
5,Can t get better than this! I will definitely make again
5,Mmm soooo good! Thanks a million! Super soft and delicious.
5,I love anything with that fall like spice to it! This is probably the best recipe for this kind of cookie yet. Like another commenter said there are soft and sooo delicious. My husband doesn t usually like spice kind of cookies but he absolutely LOOOVED these! Whoo Hoo!
5,I recently joined AllRecipies and this is the first recipe I tried. And I loved it!
4,it was good
5,I ve never heard my kids say mmm so many times. I liked them just as much and the recipe wasn t to complicated. Highly recommended.
5,WOW!
5,"excellent!! i browned ground beef, drained the fat, used 3 Tbsp per pound of meat and i added 1/2 Tbsp flour to the seasoning and mixed thoroughly before dusting the meat with it. i added 2/3 cup of water, mixed it up with the ground beef and let it simmer down. would be great with shredded beef or chicken too.it is def hotter than the packaged stuff, so if you don&apos;t like hot, would reccommend cutting the red pepper flakes. it is salty too. don&apos;t substitute sea salt for table salt. it is not an even swap. i did cut the sea salt down slightly...i am making a huge batch of this, sealing it in mason jars with my foodsaver and giving as gifts for christmas. thanks for sharing. i will never go back to packaged mix!!"
5,"This is a fantastic seasoning recipe! Like others have mentioned, no more seasoning packets for me. The flavor was so much richer. I didn&apos;t tell anyone of the change (I cook for a family of 10) and got lots of excellent compliments. I did receive one complaint about the dish I made, but it came from from a very picky young man who thinks that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food. :-)  After the first time I used this recipe, I made up a large batch of seasoning to have on hand. It was so easy since I had all of the spices in my pantry anyway. I found that 2 *very* heaping tablespoons of the seasoning equals about one regular seasoning packet. My family likes things a little spicy though, so two regular tablespoons would probably be sufficient."
5,"I substituted 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper for the red pepper flakes, and my VERY PICKY 12 year old daughter loved it in our homemade taco dip & taco&apos;s as well!  (I would however suggest maybe just the 1 tsp. of cumin).  We figured out that 21/2 - 3 tablespoons = one 1.25 oz. packet, which I will NEVER go back to!  Thanks so much Bill!"
3,"Of course, I tweaked it to up the garlic and onion to double. I&apos;m a garlic/onion lover, and sometimes I substitute out those for the fresh version instead.  I added 1 tsp of cornstarch (or 2 tsp of flour will work) to the mix which allows the spices to cling more readily to the meat as a thickened sauce. The spice mixture is great, but sometime was missing.  I looked around at a few other recipes and found one mentioning a beef bullion cube.  I have Better than Bullion paste (beef or chicken) and add a tsp while cooking the beef.  What a difference! It really gives  the meaty flavor that was lacking (hard to believe more meatiness is needed in a pound of ground beef, but it&apos;s true).  Whichever recipe you use, try adding some meat stock paste or equivalent (but do consider the added salt from bullion if you like it not too salty).  Also this recipe doesn&apos;t mention it, but adding a 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water towards the end after browning the meat with the seasoning allows the flavor to really mingle and absorb as you heat and reduce the sauce down a bit (that&apos;s where the cornstatch cling really shines). The water addition is just the basic instruction from the old packets I used to buy and it&apos;s not a step I&apos;d ever skip."
5,"This is excellent. It definitely tastes like the packet I usually used (will use this from now on). We mixed 1 lb. of browned-and-drained ground beef, this seasoning mix, plus a mixture of 2 tsp. of cornstarch and 2/3 cup of cold water. Then, we left it on low until all of it was warm."
5,"This recipe was a life-saver!! After already mixing ingrediants for ""seven layer taco dip,"" I realized that I was out of taco seasoning. Frantic, I ran to the computer and found this! YEAH!! I mixed it in with some cream cheese and sour cream to taste it first and it was great.  Worked even better in the dip!! If I&apos;d had known how easy this was, I would have been making my own taco seasoning for a while now!! The only thing I changed was reduced the chili powder to 1/2 TBLS.  Very good and will make again!! Thanks Bill for posting this!"
5,"Very quick.  No reason to buy pre-packaged Taco Seasoning.  I followed recipe except slightly decreased amt of red pepper flakes and omitted onion powder (didn&apos;t have any).  I cooked 1 & 1/4 lb. low fat ground beef with fresh garlic; poured off fat.  Added Taco seasoning + 1/2 c. fresh, chopped onions + 1 cup water. Brought to boil and simmered for about 15 min.  Next time I would decrease water to 2/3 or 3/4 cup (I had a little too much liquid, but not a problem).  Very good.  DH loved these tacos!"
4,used regular salt.  seems to be very good.  3 tbs. equals one packet.
5,"This is absolutely delicious!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will NEVER go back to buying pre-packaged taco seasoning!! I love that I can make this recipe organically and especially love the fact that it is MSG FREE!! 
                                
                                I found that if you add approximately 2/3 cup water to 3 tablespoons seasoning per pound of meat it makes the best flavor. I also prefer to add 1 Tablespoon flour to the recipe as this allows the seasoning to ""stick"" to the meat."
5,"This is an excellent basic recipe and I have made it several times, but may I suggest a couple of things:  First, instead of using flour, try crushed corn flake cereal - use your own judgement as to the correct amount, but enough to thicken the mixture. You will have a crisp patty. Second, my grandmother advised me a long time ago that when using canned fish, to always add a pinch or two of white sugar - some how does away with the tin can taste.  It works too!"
3,"I&apos;m a huge salmon fan and I thought this recipe was so easy and very tasty.  I made one change...instead of frying in oil, I sprayed a baking pan heavily with Pam, placed the patties, which I rolled in a bit of bread crumbs, onto the baking pan, then sprayed each patty with Pam.  I baked in a 375 degree oven for about 20 minutes, turning once.  they were golden brown, but tender on the inside and not one bit greasy.  they were out of this world!"
4,I just wanted to make a quick comment---I&apos;m familiar with this recipe; it&apos;s identical in every way to my mother&apos;s EXCEPT my mom and I always add about a quarter cup of flour to the mixture to help it stick together.  It works much better this way and you don&apos;t lose any flavor.
4,"This recipe provided an excellent framework. I did tweak the directions though. Instead of using 2 eggs, I just used 1. I then used 2 tablespoons of miracle whip, 1 cup of plain bread crumbs, and 1½ teas of Old Bay, the last two being what many others suggested. My husband tasted it and was immediately impressed. Since I&apos;ve tried to make other recipes or bought store kits before, he said this is the recipe I should use from now on. But, since I like my cakes a little spicy, I think I&apos;ll use more Old Bay, or try a little dill the next time."
5,"I&apos;m on the Atkins Diet and this is a perfect meal for anyone who is doing the low-carb, high-protein thing.  Therefore, adding flour is not an option, and in my opinion totally unnecessary.  The mixture may seem a little loose at first but if the salmon is drained well and the mixture well-blended, they should come out perfectly (as mine did on the first try).  The only additions I made were garlic powder and chopped green onion. Very tasty!"
4,"When using canned salmon there is no need to remove the bones.  They have a high nutritional value.  Just crush them up with you fingers and they are undetectable in the finished product.  Also,  I shape them like fish sticks and bake them.  The kids love them this way."
4,I like this recipe much better than salmon cakes with bread crumbs.  Tastes better and is low carb!!  I minced the onion and used a medium sized onion.  The patties held together very well. It may have helped that I put the mixture in the frig for about 30 minutes before I formed the patties.  I also added a little seasoned salt.
5,I love most fish or seafood cakes and the simplicity of this recipe has made this one of my quick backup meals.  I have not found that one needs to modify the recipe except for one step: refrigerate the cakes once shaped for 20-30 minutes.  It will prevent the cakes from breaking up during cooking.
4,"These are really good...especially if you like canned fish.  I like to mince my onions rather than chop because I don&apos;t like ""chunks"" of onions in anything.  The amount of ingredients are right on...they mold the salmon mixture together perfectly.  I like to sprinkle garlic powder on mine...I do that with almost everything I prepare.  These are great pan fried...wonder how they would taste baked??  Thanks Jessica."
5,"WONDERFUL!  For a perfect, soft sugar cookie, the following small modifications will get you there...use butter instead of marg, and melt it over the stove.  It helps to dissolve the sugar, and to help sugars and butters cream better. Use only 3 cups flour.  Finally, oven temp at 350 and baking cookies for 8-10 minutes keeps it soft.  Lining with parchment paper also helps.  Keep an eye out...they will seem too pale to remove from the oven, but just when the center doesn&apos;t look ""wet"" anymore, it is done.  They still bake for 2 or so minutes, so they will darken up a little and be perfect. FYI--when rolling these out, keep the dough nice and thick...the cookie will be crisp (still good)if it is too thin."
5,"These cookies came out soft, fluffy, and delicious.  The dough was simple to 
                                make and easy to work with.  However IMO, some adjustments are 
                                necessary to make this recipe perfect: 1) Only add 3 cups of flour to the dough,
                                then use 1/2 cup to roll them out.  2) Use butter instead of margerine to give 
                                them better flavor and texture.  3) Bake them at 350 degrees instead of 400 
                                to let them puff up and make them softer.
                                Make sure not to roll them too thin or overbake them.  They should have only a
                                trace of brown around the edges.  Enjoy :)"
5,"these cookies puffed up nicely and held their shape when using cookie cutters.  Very buttery and not overly sweet. They tasted wonderful with just a bit of colored sugar sprinkled on top.  I did add some cinnamon, nutmeg, and a tablespoon of molasses and used half white sugar and half brown sugar to one batch to make snicker-doodles and they turned out great.  This is a wonderful sugar cookie recipe that can be used as base for many kinds of cookies.  I am a  professional pastry chef and have access to many recipes and this is one of the best I have come across."
5,"FANTASTIC!  I have made these MANY times now, and they are always well-received.  I do make some recommended changes:  butter instead of margarine, 3 1/3 cups flour and sub 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup powdered sugar for the 1 1/2 cups white sugar called for.  I also use powdered sugar - as opposed to flour - when rolling them out.  These are easy to handle, and hold up FABULOUSLY . . . tasting great even a week later! I use the Sugar Cookie Icing on this site, and they always look amazing.  A side note:  the first time I made these I made a batch of this recipe AND a batch of the Best Rolled Sugar Cookies, and these were by FAR better - both in texture and taste."
5,I have been trying to find the perfect cut out cookie recipe and this is the best so far. Like some others I also used butter and I cut back the flour to 3 cups.  I wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and divided it in two as it made it easier to work with. I reduced the heat to 350 and cooked the cookies approximately 10 minutes. Be sure you don&apos;t roll out the dough too thin or they will be a harder crispier cookie. I used Barbara&apos;s Butter Icing for Cookies and it was excellent.  These definitely rate 5 stars
5,"This is the first time I ever successfully made sugar cookies.  They were wonderful.  I did follow recommendations of reducing flour to 3 cups, oven temp to 350 and used butter instead of margarine."
5,These cookies definitely lived up to all the great reviews. They were soft and chewy long after being cooled. I do regret icing the cookies since they were a little sweet for my taste afterwards. I didn&apos;t chill the dough since I made use of a cookie press which proved to be a time and mess saver. Thanks for the great recipe!!! I just made these again and I had to come back to say that they were perfect using cookie cutters. I followed the recipe exactly except I refrigerated the dough overnight and cooked the cookies for 9 minutes at 350 F. Delicious!
3,These really were perfect for cut-out cookies. I had no problem rolling out the dough and they kept their shape nicely. The texture was spot on. However by themselves they aren&apos;t stellar in the taste department and definately benefit from an icing of some sort. Regardless I will be using this recipe alot. I may add a 1/2 tsp almond extract or some orange zest or something to spruce them up. Thanks for sharing!
5,"These are by far the best sugar cookies I have ever had! I made Valentine cut-outs for my daughter&apos;s class and my family loved them so much that I made another batch the next weekend for my kids to decorate. I used 3 1/4 cups flour and real butter. Larger thick cookies come out even softer. I bake just until the centers are set then leave them on the cookie sheet for a minute to ""cook"" a little longer before putting them on the racks. WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL!!"
4,"Realy really, good! But it took me a few tries to get the technique right. This might help: the chocolate has the be very hot and the balls must be very cold for the chocolate to stick right. I melted the chocolate in the microwave, so I popped it back in for about a minute every couple minutes;  and DONT take the balls out of the freezer until RIGHT before you are about to dip them. They will start to sweat after being out for a few minutes and this will keep the chocolate from sticking."
5,"I&apos;ve made this recipe several times and everyone loves them!  I use 4 cups confectioner&apos;s sugar and 2 cups peanut butter.  A few other techniques that have helped: chill the peanut butter mixture in the fridge 30 minutes before making the balls - this will help make a smoother, rounder buckeye. Also, melt more chocolate than the recipe calls for so you have a good pool of chocolate to dip the ball into (you&apos;ll throw chocolate away, but it will make the product look better)."
5,"For those of you who do not wish to use the stove top, try using a crock pot. The chocolate melts easy and stays melted for as long as you need. Remember to set it on low. If you don&apos;t plan on using your crock pot soon, cover and reuse chocolate at another time."
5,"Quick tip for easier dipping. The obvious one of melting the chocolate in the microwave. I&apos;ve made these since high school and never thought of that! The next tip is to use an ice cream scoop to get a scoop of chocolate and then dip the balls in that. The ice cream scoop gets enough chocolate in it to make 3-4 small buckeyes and if it falls off the toothpick, it&apos;s not falling far! It also helps to get a full, nice covering of chocolate instead of having to roll around the ball to get the top partially covered. Then, you can use a shallower bowl instead of something too deep for the chocolate."
4,I&apos;ve been eating my grandmother&apos;s wonderful Buckeyes all my life so I decided to give this recipe a try (since I didn&apos;t have her recipe handy). I would recommend this recipe with the following tweaks: definitely cut the sugar and sift it- I used about 4 cups which worked well; add a tablespoon or two of shortening to the chocolate to help it stay a little firmer at room temperature; use semi-sweet chocolate as specified(I used a blend of milk choc and semi-sweet and it was too sweet); and to save time just microwave the chocolate at a medium setting and stir periodically- it comes out perfectly creamy and there&apos;s no need for the messy double broiler. What a great holiday treat! Yummy!
5,This recipe is AWESOME!!! I did a little altering... For the peanut butter I used Smuckers Natural creamy peanut butter(it has no trans fat. I am pretty much a health freak.) Smart Balance buttery spread(this stuff rocks to cook/bake with!) and I didn&apos;t have any semi sweet chocolate so I used Bittersweet chocolate chips. Everything was Perfect!!! Also instead of melting the chocolate on the stove I put it in the microwave and stirred it every 40 seconds or so. Much quicker!!! You have to try the recipe this way. It is about as close to healthy buckeyes as you can get!!
4,"I make buckeyes every holiday season for my students (I teach high school).  This recipie is great.  I only have one hint.  Add some parafin wax to the melted chocolate.  The wax will thin out the chocolate and make it easier to dip.  Plus, you won&apos;t use so much chocolate...this is especially helpful if you are making a double or triple batch like I do every year"
3,HELP!!! I can&apos;t figure out what I did to this recipe. My mixture is too fluffy and when i started rolling them into balls they stuck to my hands and now they look like little porcupines. I added the correct measurements but something happened. I wonder if using my kitchenaid mixer was too much.
4,Rolling the balls was very sticky so I put powdered sugar on a paper plate and dipped both palms in after rolling each ball and it worked wonders; balls came out smooth. I also decreased the sugar in the recipe to about 4 cups and sifted first.
5,"I make this all the time, and it&apos;s unbelievably good!  I use this recipe exactly, except I&apos;ve never tried it with garlic.  I&apos;m going to try it next time! Also, instead of tossing the asparagus with the parmesan, I toss with all the other ingredients and lay in a single layer, then sprinkle the parmesan all over the top.  I bake mine at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the asparagus.  Oh, and a hint: if you line the baking sheet with aluminum foil, there&apos;s hardly any clean up!"
5,"I prepared the asparagus exactly as the recipe indicated, including all the optional ingredients.  It was delicious, but very salty.  I recommend reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp or 1/4 tsp."
5,I make asparagus this way all the time!  Didn&apos;t know it could taste so good!  Do add the garlic though...I don&apos;t use the lemon juice.  400 degrees for 10 minutes works in my oven.
5,"Best way I&apos;ve cooked asparagus yet!  I coated the asparagus with everything but the parmesan cheese.  Then when I put it on a foil lined cookie sheet, I sprinkled the cheese.  When it cooked the cheese got crispy and gave it a kind of deep fried texture.  It was great, and easy and will make it this way everytime."
5,"Optional Parmesan, garlic, and lemon juice - a definite yes to all three! This is excellent and turned out perfectly."
4,"Nice recipe, however I prefer my asparagus to be a little crisper. 12 minutes was too long for the thick stalks I had... 8 minutes would be about right at 425."
4,"A tasty, easy-to-prepare asparagus recipe. Like other reviewers I would say 12 minutes is altogether too long for thin stalks. Six to eight minutes works for me. I added all the optional ingredients, except the lemon juice, halved the salt and oil (there was lots) and served with Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze (also from this site). Thanks for the recipe."
5,"Be sure to follow the footnote tip to remove tough part of stem by snapping the asparagus in two.  The fresher it is, the better this works, so I do this as soon as I get home from the store (also makes weeknight cooking quicker & easier when I am ready to make).  I also like to line the baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up.  Instead of tossing with olive oil I spray with cooking spray after the asparagus is spread in an even layer on the sheet.  I promise it tastes just as good.  Then I sprinkle with coarse salt & fine pepper (sprinkle from up high to more evenly distribute the seasonings)."
5,"I used fresh long green beans instead of asparagus, because the asparagus was out of season. delicious!"
2,I used half the salt and still it was way to salty. otherwise it was good.
5,"These brownies are magnificent!!! I mean ""melt in your mouth"" and I didn&apos;t even make the frosting. I doubled the recipe and it still won&apos;t be enough. There are a few tips that will ensure your brownies are not cakey. I do not use a mixer because you can overmix your batter and whip too much air into the eggs. This makes your brownies have a cakey texture. Mix everything by hand in a bowl and lightly beat your eggs before adding them to the mixture. Gently stirring everything together makes them turn out better as opposed to franticly beating the mixture. Hope this helps, because I will NEVER buy brownie mix again."
5,"I doubled the recipe and made a 9x13 pan of these brownies for a party, and everybody loved them!  I also entered them in my local county fair and won first place.  The problem with the frosting is that you need to halve the amount of powdered sugar and melt the butter.  This makes a glaze that you can spread on top.  It hardens into a beautiful, shiny frosting.  I thought some of the info in the reviews was conflicting, so here&apos;s the scoop:  1.  These are neither ""cake"" brownies nor ""fudge"" brownies; they fall somewhere in between.  If you must have one or the other, then this recipe is not for you.  2.  Yes, the frosting is sweet.  If you like frosting, then add it, if not, leave it off.  3.  Yes, these are homemade brownies and do not taste like boxed brownie mix.  I can&apos;t understand why anyone would prefer a mix to homemade, but if that&apos;s your thing, then stick with the mix."
5,These are great!  I changed the recipe to make them better for you.  I used 1/2 c. applesauce instead of butter and 1/2 cup Equal spoonfuls and 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 cup sugar and used egg substitute and omitted the glaze.  They ended up with only 45 calories apiece and 0 grams of fat!  they were SOOOO GOOOD!!! :-)
1,"Brownies...
                                
                                What comes to mind? Hard...chewy...
                                
                                These brownies...
                                
                                What comes to mind? Soft...cakelike...
                                
                                These were baaaaad.......why must all these brownie recipes result in cake squares? I wish I could say different for this supposedly ""best brownie"" recipe, but I can&apos;t. If you are looking for the traditional delicious brownie Grandma used to make, run, run away and never come back!
                                These were just like a cake. Be aware: These are not the BEST brownies...these are the BEST cake squares."
5,"These were the BEST BROWNIES even without the frosting.  Just don&apos;t OVERBAKE/OVERMIX.  When doubling, leave out one egg, keep the amount of salt at 1/4 tsp, and bake for 30-35 mins.  You&apos;ll get a cakey on the outside, fudgey in the middle brownie.  Delish!"
5,"Wonderful little brownie! Not too thick, not too thin, just right! Comes together and into the oven in less than 5 minutes. I added about 1 additional T. of cocoa. Just mix all ingredients with a wooden spoon in the same pan as you melted the butter, about 50 strokes, just until good and combined. The frosting is glossy and smooth if you melt the butter first and add about 1 T. each of corn syrup and half and half. Cutting these with a plastic knife, even the disposable tableware variety, works great!  Cuts cleanly, and not a crumb sticks to the knife. Had to try 3 of the brownies as soon as they were cooled, just to be triply sure they were good."
4,"Many moons ago I worked in a Duncan Hines test kitchen and have made up to 20 batches of brownies a day and let me say this is a good, easy recipe for homemade brownies; great chocolatey flavor. 
                                I would suggest:
                                1) Slightly whip (with fork) the eggs to make them homogenous first before adding them to the pan&apos;s other ingredients.
                                2) Whisk your dry ingredients, flour, cocoa, salt and baking powder, together first before adding them to the pan.  No need to beat with mixer.  A wooden spoon to mix the batter until everything is wet works just fine.
                                I used the frosting recipe which was very fudge-like and thick. I added just a smidgen of water to thin it out to make it at least somewhat spreadable."
5,"This recipe needs another review like I need another brownie - but I just couldn&apos;t stop eating them.  Mama Cass hit the nail on the head saying this was neither a ""fudgy"" brownie nor a ""cake-like"" brownie, but both - that&apos;s what made it so awesome.  I didn&apos;t have the honey for the frosting so frosted it with the best chocolate frosting IMO - boil 3TB butter, 1/3 c sugar, 2TB milk for a minute, remove from heat and add 1/3 c chocolate chips.  Yummmm!  Doubt anyone will read this after 1,000 some reviews, but just realized this recipe is similar to one a use for waffle cookies - only I melt the butter and cocoa powder in the microwave together and it mixes together much easier.  Just a thought."
5,"Worth a try, very easy recipe yielding above average brownies.  When the recipe
                                says not to overcook, don&apos;t...depending on your oven 25 minutes is probably long 
                                enough.  They may not look done, but they continue to cook/settle when removed.
                                Also, I had to add an egg to the frosting recipe because I ended up with chocolate 
                                sawdust without it (even using electric blender).  Some folks also mentioned adding
                                milk (1 Tblsp ?) because of this which would also work I&apos;m sure."
5,Quick and easy. I used margarine instead of butter and homogenized milk instead of heavy cream. I did not need to use any thickening agents-the consistency was just right. Just toss with fettucine and serve.
5,"You would not believe how incredible this sauce is!  My husband and I made this sauce (served over fettuccine noodles) for my friend and her husband, as they just had their third child a few days ago and we figured they could use the break from cooking - they went nuts, they loved it so much!  Even their two younger sons (3 and 2) loved this dish.  It literally tastes IDENTICAL to the sauce that they serve at the Olive Garden.  Another good tip is to add a can of drained mushrooms to the sauce - it really tastes great.  I&apos;d give this 6 stars if I could - I will NEVER buy alfredo sauce again!  The next time I might use milk and a little cornstarch instead of the cream (as one previous reviewer suggested) and perhaps reduced fat margarine to save on fat and calories.  Be sure to use fresh shredded parmesan (available in bags in the dairy section), Kraft grated just doesn&apos;t do it as well - and the shredded parm melts really well.  ENJOY this incredible dish!  Thank you, Rebecca!  :)"
4,"Very good flavor in this recipe, but I did add a 2nd clove of garlic. If you just stir the cream into the butter and let it simmer, it will seperate. I gently whisk the cream and butter the entire time it&apos;s simmering and whisk while adding the cheese (a little at a time) and it doesn&apos;t seperate, even after a day in the fridge. The consistency is a little hard to get smooth, but probably because parmesan is a very hard cheese with a granular texture to begin with, and doesn&apos;t melt smoothly. I used a parmesan/asiago blend and it was beautifully smooth after lots of whisking. Also, make sure you use unsalted butter - if you use margarine or lightly salted butter, it&apos;s way too salty. I used this recipe to make a white chicken lasagna, which was absolutely delicious, and it held up well in the refrigerator to have leftovers the next day."
5,"Holy Moly! My husband loves alfredo, and he freaked out because this was so good. I made a double recipe, added 1.5 pounds of pan seared chicken breast and poured it over tri-color rotini (it was the only pasta in the house). Unbelievable! It was a little thin at first, but thickened as it cooled. I used genuine Parmesan Reggiano and it melted wonderfully smooth--just be sure to add only a handful at a time. Do not boil, or the sauce will separate."
1,"Bland & throughly uninspired. My husband was none too pleased, and my children were less than enthused which is a far cry from their usual elation with my Italian cooking. I made this for my family yesterday, and recognized the taste right away as being a recipe I&apos;ve made before though not from this site (copy cat recipes; the book actually). I added 1/8 tsp ground pepper since the flavor was sadly lacking. While I know that I&apos;m am a tough critic having lived for 3 years in Italy this wasn&apos;t even passable to my husband who has only visited there with me. This alfredo is fine for someone with a bland palate, but if it&apos;s flavor you crave then move on to a recipe more original and authentic."
5,I love this recipe and make it for my boyfriend at least once a week!  We add an extra quarter cup of fresh Parmesan cheese and a tablespoon of flour...it makes the sauce much less runny.
5,"I made this recipe for my x-mother and father-in-law last weekend. She is an avid vegetarian but will eat seafoods. I made the alfrado using the Gruyere cheese, then in a separate skillet sauted 4 chopped green onions, 1T crushed garlic, and 2T fresh chopped parsley in 2T olive oil, added 1lb cleaned devained shrimp and 1 can lump crab meat over medium heat until shrimp turned pink then folded into the alfrado sauce and served over linguini."
5,"I tried this recipe using 2 different types of parmesan cheese, the shredded kind and the finely grated kind (think Kraft green container).  The shredded was SOOO much better, though both times I used a bit more cream and a bit less cheese.  I used equal amounts and added about a 1/4 cup of cream extra and did about a 1/4 cup less cheese.  We served it with grilled chicken (marinade in Itailian dressing)and grilled red peppers.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe.  Ths was the best alfredo I&apos;ve ever had!"
4,"Very good basic Alfredo sauce. Remember to keep the sauce at a slow simmer, and never bring to the boil. The high heat will cause the cheese to turn grainy... a slow simmer will keep it smooth and creamy.
                                Note: A simmer is where the temperature of the liquid is just below the boiling point, or where small bubbles come to the surface and break gently.
                                You could try different cheeses... why not, or you could substitute the parsley with another herb, such as, Cilantro.
                                
                                Oh, and I enjoy a bit more garlic... keeps the Vampires away."
5,"This is the only recipe that my family has ever used, and it&apos;s the only one I use and will continue to use...This makes the creamiest, most delicious fudge that you will ever eat, and it&apos;s simple to make too! Sometimes I will use white choco. chips and add nuts, cherries, etc.... or white chips w/ maple flavoring and walnuts. I have done so many different flavor combinations w/ this recipe, and it always turns out fantastic~YUM! :) NOTE: If you happen to have a candy thermometer handy, you will want to bring the mixture to 234 degrees, then continue w/ the recipe. I find that I have better luck using a thermometer than just timing it."
3,"The original recipe says to boil the sugar mixture until the temperature reaches 234°F on a candy thermometer.  I&apos;ve made this every year for the last 15 years or so.  Trust me, 5 minutes of boiling WILL NOT bring the mixture to 234°.  It takes at least twice that long, maybe longer.  Here is the actual original recipe.  http://www.kraftrecipes.com/recipes/fantasy-fudge-51833.aspx"
5,"I have made this recipe for decades now and it&apos;s just as good now as it was then! This is THE best fudge recipe. Use butter for sure, it lends so much better flavor than margarine. I have never used marshmallow creme though, just a bag of good old miniature marshmallows, 10 ounces is fine or the bigger bag of 16 ounces is okay too. They melt in just fine along with the chocolate chips. That way, you can just keep marshmallows and chocolate chips on hand, they&apos;re good for many other things, and then you&apos;re ready to make this on the spur of the moment. If you want, you can stir the miniature marshmallows in not quite completely in, and you have a rocky-road fudge. Also, I toast 2 cups or more of walnut or pecan halves in the oven (about 350 degrees, maybe 10 minutes?) till they are fragrant and slightly colored. The toasted nuts taste fantastic in this fudge, and there&apos;s no need to chop them at all!"
5,"I used butter instead of margerine, chopped pecans instead of walnuts and pure vanilla extract. We LOVE this fudge. Out of the whole pan that I sliced, only four pieces remain. Very simple fudge recipe with excellent results--it really tastes like something you&apos;d buy from a specialty shop!"
5,"This is the best recipe for fudge. But, for 20 years I&apos;ve been making it in the microwave. I cook it on High for 11 minutes, stirring after 3 minutes, then 6 minutes, then 9 minutes. Take it out 2 minutes later and add your chocolate, fluff, and vanilla! Perfect every time. Substitute the chocolate with 1 cup peanut butter for the creamiest peanut butter fudge going!!!"
5,"This is the BEST without a doubt.  Have made this particular recipe many times.  To Chris who had fudge that didn&apos;t set up.  If you want to try this again, buy a candy thermometer and cook until it&apos;s 234 degrees, then remove from the stove and add, marshmallow, choc. chips, and vanilla.  If it gets not hot enough it will be mushy.  TOO hot and it will crystalize.  To have directions that read EX number of minutes on the stove just doesn&apos;t quite do it. Some people have electric stoves, others gas burners.  Best to use a thermometer and not run the risk of wasting all your ingredients.  I, myself, learned this the hard way."
5,"I&apos;ve been making this for 30+ years, and I&apos;ve never had it not set up.  I&apos;ve done both the microwave and the stove top versions.  I made some today on the stove top.  I used a large pot, more like a dutch oven than a saucepan.   Always get it to a full, rolling boil before starting your timer (a rolling boil being one that boils vigorously even when you&apos;re stirring).  Give it the full five minutes.  I&apos;ve never used a thermometer.   I like to pour it into two 9 inch pie pans when I&apos;m giving it away as gifts."
5,"I have read where a reviewer says this is not the original recipe - then they give a link to the ""original"" they think it is... but sorry that link takes to me what is similar to what is NOW on the fluff jar using the baking chocolate. The recipe here sounds much more like I remember from my umpteen years of this recipe. Thanks so much for posting this recipe! I was so sad when they changed it! It just isn&apos;t the same!"
5,"I love this fudge....the traditional method from the back of the Kraft Marshmallow jar is combine sugar, margarine and milk in heavy 2-1/2 quart saucepan; bring to full rolling boil, stirring constantly.  Continue boiling for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring.  Remove from heat, stir in chocolate till melted.  Add marshmallow creme, nuts & vanilla beat till blended.  Pour into greased 13x9 inch baking pan. Cool at room temp.;; cut into small squares.  Also I use a table sppon of vanilla."
5,"These are THE BEST Russian Tea cookies I have ever tried, baked and eaten!!  For people getting a crumbly dough, just add about 1 tablespoon milk and your problem is solved!  I do this and ALWAYS get a perfectly moist dough to work with.  Just make sure you keep mixing the dough until no trace of white flour is left and dough comes together and is a little tacky.  Using an electric mixer with a dough paddle is ideal.  I do roll the balls in regular sugar before baking and roll it in powdered sugar TWICE for a nice, white, sweet coating. No worries, it will be perfectly sweet.  This cookie can also stay fresh for a very long time in an airtight container.  I made two batches that lasted me well over a week and it tasted as good as the first day.  I&apos;ve also used almond extract in place of vanilla and it tasted just as wonderful.  Last tip - the finer you chop/grind the walnuts, the less your cookie will crumble when being eaten!  I&apos;ve used this recipe dozens of times and it&apos;s perfect EVERYTIME!  Try this, you WON&apos;T regret it."
5,"I&apos;m a first generation Russian/Ukrainian - American and my husband is a ""right off the boat"" Russian.  I have used this recipe (slightly modified using pecans instead of almonds, and a little less flour, at 310 degrees) for several years now at our church&apos;s annual Old Country Christmas bake sale.  We are a Russian Orthodox, and to us Old Country means THE old country, not country-western, and people visit our sale to find those ""real homemade ethnic"" baked goods.  This has always sold out on the first day, even when I make 100 dozen.  It doesn&apos;t get much better than this!"
5,"These are just fantastic. But wow for once I do not agree with the most helpful rated review. I did not care for the cookie rolled in sugar at all.  I used both pecans and walnuts and liked the walnut better - the slight bitter taste of the nut was a perfect complement to the powdered sugar of the cookie. I ground the walnuts in my coffee grinder. I used a bit less flour (3 TBS less) than recommended for my second batch and that turned out better. Note that batter will be crumbly but when you roll it into a ball in your hand it will come together - just squeeze a bit!  Also, when I rolled warm cookies in the powdered sugar they didn&apos;t even need a second roll! (warm and being able to hold in your hand without feeling YOW!, not hot or the powdered sugar will melt). Although I prefer walnut the most, this cookie is great with any kind of nut or flavoring - even pistachio. Roll in cinnamon and powdered sugar for something different."
5,"I have the same exact recipe handed down from my grandmother and it is absolutely divine!!!  I made three dozen of these for the office over the holidays and they were gobbled up.  Another person brought the same kind of cookies on the same day I did and unfortunately for the poor dear, her&apos;s just set there while mine steadily disappeared.   HINT:  Whatever nut I happen to be using (walnut or pecan), I grind down a little extra until it is essentially dust and add it to the powdered sugar prior to rolling the balls ~ I think it gives the cookie an extra edge...  Thanks so much for the recipe!"
4,The first time I tried this recipe the dough was too dry and crumbly to roll into balls. The second time it worked much better. The secret is to have the butter very soft and warm but not melted. Room temperature butter is not soft enough.
5,To answer a previous reviewer&apos;s question I think you do want to use salted butter because the Betty Crocker recipe for Russian Tea Cakes calls for 1/4 tsp salt. I made that recipe for the first time a couple of weeks ago and today wanting more Russian Tea Cakes decided to try the recipe on this site to compare. Both recipes are excellent. The Betty Crocker recipe calls 2 1/4 cup sifed flour and 1/2 cup sifted confectioner&apos;s sugar in the recipe slightly less nuts and rolling around in the sugar two times (once when still warm) but otherwise it&apos;s the same. That recipe results in dough that is slightly stiffer and thus easier to work with in rolling into balls. The taste is slightly less buttery melt-in-your mouth and instead is a bit stiffer which is not a bad thing. (BTW I did sift the flour and sugar together for this recipe.) My husband loved both too but said he grew up with the BC recipe so prefers it very slightly over this one. Either one would have been fine with me (I didn&apos;t grow up with these) but the BC recipe dough is easier to work with so I was just as glad he chose that one.
5,My mom made these every year and I was very happy to find the perfect recipe. The only thing I would change would be the oven temperature. I baked mine at 300 for about 15 minutes. I took them out when the bottoms were light golden brown and let them sit for a few minutes before I rolled them in the powdered sugar. These are great. Very delicate and rich. Thanks for sharing.
5,Rich buttery nutty melt-in-your-mouth little morsels!These were awesome shortbread type cookies that give a crushing sensation when you bite into them. I used pecans finely ground and shaped them with a melon baller for uniformity. Roll them in the sugar while they are warm then again when they are cooled. Thanks Odette!
5,These were great! I used 1/2 cup powdered sugar in the batter instead of 6 Tbl. (per another recipe I found and had used before). I found that you need about 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar for rolling especially if you roll them twice which I did. I also prefer to use finely chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Thanks for the recipe!
3,These cookies are VERY time consuming!  I made a double batch for a baby shower and found myself wishing I&apos;d made something else.  The taste was just okay.  But - 2 of my friends did say they were great.
5,"One of the best cookies EVER. Made them for Xmas to bring to school. They sat untouched compared to all the extravagant other cookies, but I forced people to try them. The result: my friend held two cookies in each hand literally SHOVING them in his mouth because they all got eaten in five minutes; there was a mad rush to get them and needless to say I brought none back home. Only problem with the recipe I can see is that the dough is very sticky and hard to form in balls. My suggestion is to drop the dough directly into the sugar and then form the balls as the sugar coats the dough and allows you to roll it. Also, I used a tablespoon of orange juice instead of water to bring out the ginger flavor and it worked extremely well."
5,"These cookies are delicious!!  They are also easy to make but you need to let the mix sit for a good 40-50 minutes before rolling into cookie form, otherwise you&apos;ll just be playing with a big gooey mess.  I wish I knew that before I got my hands in it."
4,"these cookies are very tasty, granted, yes.  however, i was terribly annoyed to find that i had big gingerbread balls because of the directive:  lightly flatten cookie.  you need to really flatten the cookie out to get a result like that in the photo.  i would make them again, and will really squash em down."
5,"If I could have rated these 10 stars, I would have. These cookies were autumn/winter perfection! Moist and chewy all the way through. I made mine smaller, rolling the dough into about 3/4 inch balls. They came out the size of a ginger snap. I made the first batch to give as a gift, but they disappeared before I could give them away. Now I have to make another batch tonight. Thank you for a recipe I&apos;ll use for years to come. 
                                
                                *edit*
                                On the second batch I took the advice of another reviewer and used orange juice instead of water. I didn&apos;t think it would make that much of a difference, but the subtle change MADE these cookies. My boyfriend considers himself a cookie connoisseur (and a picky one to boot) and he says these are the best cookies he&apos;s ever eaten - bar none."
5,WARNING...DANGER AHEAD...do not make these cookies unless you are on an all cookie diet. You have been warned.
5,"Wow!  These are the best cookies ever!  They came out looking great - tasted even better!  Like others, I also put the dough into the freezer for about 30 minutes.  It makes a HUGE difference.  I baked mine for 10 minutes - they still stayed moist.  I am planning to give these cookies as gifts for Christmas.  Thanks for the great recipe!
                                
                                **Unfortunately, these cookies didn&apos;t last long enough to give away as gifts.  So I made another batch - this time I used fresh grated ginger, and instead of water for the liquid, I used Brandy-Orange Liqueur.  What a difference!  A nice taste for the holidays.  Next time, I&apos;ll try Grand Marnier, Cointreau, Spiced Rum, etc....the possibilities are endless!  Thanks again for the great recipe!"
5,"Oh, my gosh...  These are so good!  The spices balance out nicely.  We usually go for chocolate chip cookies, but even my picky 7-year-old son loves these.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of margarine to get the buttery taste.  Instead of water, I followed other reviewers&apos; advice and used fresh orange juice.  However, I&apos;m not sure the juice made any difference.  Before measuring the molasses, I sprayed the measuring cup with cooking spray so the molasses would slide out easily.  I rolled the dough into 1-inch balls to yield more cookies.  I will definitely use this recipe again very soon."
3,"I made these cookies and followed the recipe exactly.  My cookies tasted delicious but were flat.  I re-made this recipe the next day, using 5 T of brown sugar instead of molasses and added no water.  The cookies were able to be formed into balls immediately after mixing, no refrigeration necessary as other reviews have said.  My second batch came out big, soft, and looking just like the picture."
5,"I made these cookies for a cookie exchange.  They were a big hit and people wouldn&apos;t stop eating them.  My husband probably ate three dozen by himself.  When rolling them into balls, spray cooking spray on your hands to keep them from sticking."
5,"Very creamy and yummy. If you think your sauce is too runny before pouring it over the macaroni, it&apos;s not. I was very nervous that my sauce was not thick enough, but once I poured it over the macaroni and baked it, the dish turned out wonderful!"
4,"I have to laugh at the one who rated this 1 star for the fat and calories... who makes low cal mac & cheese? :)  This is a great recipe.  Prepare yourself for a heartattack on a plate but well worth it.  I added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and used crumbled ritz crackers as the topping.  I thought the sauce was too runny when I poured it in the pan, but as the others said, it really thickens up when in the oven. My 2 year old loves it as do we.  We accompanied it with steamed broccoli for a little healthy upswing."
4,Rave reviews at my house. Can only give 4 stars though as I followed someone else&apos;s tips on reducing milk to 1/2C. Adding 2C evapo. milk and 1/2C sour cream. I decided to double the recipe so that we would have leftovers the next day. I put half the mix in one casserole dish and the other in another dish. Baked one and stored the other un-baked one in the fridge to be put in the oven 1/2 hour before dinner the next day. Do not worry that the sauce seems runny when you add it to the noodles. It thickens up A LOT! Right after the cheese melts add it to the noodles and you&apos;re in business.
5,"Rich & Creamy. Looked a little bland, so I added minced garlic (1 tbsp), dry mustard powder (1/2 tsp)& used fresh shredded romano instead of parmesan (if you do use parmesan, use fresh shredded, if you use the grated Kraft kind in the shaker, sauce wont be smooth). Show patience with the roux. If yours came out lumpy, you didnt cook roux right or long enough (stir constantly when cooking roux)"
4,"I had to try this recipe ever since I read the rating critizing it for being loaded with ""fat"" ie CHEESE... Duh, that&apos;s what Mac and cheese is about!! I made it with large elbow macaroni so the sauce got all inside the pasta... thru in an extra 1/2 inch slice of Velveeta and some white pepper, and jazzed up the crumbs by mixing the crumbs, melted butter, paprika, onion powder, salt & pepper and then sprinkling over the top.  Very good ""old-home"" taste!!"
3,"I agree that a dash of dry mustard is missing from this recipe.   Also, if you realllly want a rich taste, try substituting half of the milk with evaporated milk.  The evaporated milk gives Mac & Cheese an amazingly rich & creamy taste.  Other than those two things, it&apos;s pretty good!"
5,"Very good!  Everybody went back for seconds.   The youngest male in the house (age 21) insisted on taking a bowl to go while his girlfriend took him to buy a couch (LOL!).  
                                
                                The parmesan cheese made the consistency  ever so slightly grainy and I might skip this ingredient next time."
5,"This is an amazing base recipe.  I boiled the noodles in 1:1 chicken broth and water, added ham and used only one cup of cheddar and added a cup of mozzerella.  Wounderful!"
5,"This recipe is delicious!  If you are wondering what 8 oz. of elbow macaroni should be in cups, it is 1 3/4 cups.  Also, bake it in an 8 x 8 glass pan.  It fits perfectly. I mixed the bread crumbs with melted butter and spread it on top of the mac and cheese and it browned in the oven.  This is now one of our family favorites."
5,"I will give this 5 stars even though, as stated before, it needs some tweeking.  Not super sweet, that is where the jam comes into play so take that into consideration when selecting your filling, which really makes them good.  I followed the directions to the tee BUT increased the second baking time to 15 minutes which makes a big differance.  I didn&apos;t raise the temp as this cookie needs to cook slow so the jam doesn&apos;t get out of control.  It is skimpy so quadrupling it is my suggestion.  A great christmas cookie.  I didn&apos;t need to chill the dough at all. This will remain a Christmas regular."
5,"I made these, but changed two things:
                                1) I didn&apos;t roll them in walnuts, but opted for sugar.
                                2) I made them miniature sized.
                                I loved how they turned out!  I will be making these again...and again...and again!"
5,"Normally I wouldn&apos;t leave a 5-star review for something I had to tweak, but this cookie is SO worth it! I got 3 bakers dozen from this recipe, measuring my dough about 2 tsp per cookie. 
                                
                                USE BUTTER. I cannot stress this enough. This is a shortbread cookie. It is not sweet, it will not spread, it will crumble slightly if cooked properly. Also, cream vanilla into butter/sugar/yolk. Most bakers already know to mix their wet, then mix the dry in a separate bowl and add to wet, but a novice baker might not.
                                
                                CHILL FINISHED DOUGH before shaping into balls. 
                                
                                ALLOW COOKIE BALLS TO WARM to room temperature before pressing your fingerprint. Cold dough will crack and make your cookie brittle.
                                
                                FILL BEFORE BAKING. After cooking for 5 min, my cookies had a crust that broke and left a brittle cookie with ugly bare streaks. When I pre-filled, the cookies were smoother, but had no coating because my daughter needed a nice looking batch for her bf. I will test this again with black sesame for good photo contrast and because it&apos;s yummy. :)
                                
                                BAKE FOR 15 MIN AT 300. I also lined my pan with ungreased foil, it makes it easier to move to cooling rack and keeps the bottom from burning.
                                
                                COOL THOROUGHLY BEFORE TOUCHING. The filling is HOT. YOU WILL GET BURNED. And it&apos;s just not fun to run to the sink with jam hardening onto your skin.
                                
                                These would be a great project for kids over 3 to help with. Just make sure they don&apos;t poke through the bottom!"
5,"These were very good. I changed them up just a little because I wanted the kind with icing in the ""thumbprint"" rather than jam (nostalgic for cookies Grandma made when I was a little girl). Then I realized I like the cookie better with more even distribution of the icing so the next batch didn&apos;t get ""thumbprints"" at all -- I just drizzled the icing over the little cookie balls. These were one of the best-liked cookies on my holiday trays."
5,"The only changes I made were as other members suggested: I baked 15 mins longer and didn&apos;t turn oven temp. up as jam needs time to set, I used a sweet jam - Smuckers Rasberry Jam, I used a sandwich baggie filled with jam and cut a small hole in corner to fill the thumbprint (my thumb is small so I presses deeper bigger dents because I love LOTS of jam - I pressed too hard and some of the cookies stuck to the pan). This recipe is a perfect amount for 2 people homes like mine. These cookies are exacty the way I remember them!!  Thank you C. Keith for this classic cookie recipe!"
4,very good recipe i changed it up a little though. I added 1/2 cup sugar and put crushed pecans in the cookie dough instead of the outside. I also baked them for 17 minutes at 350deg. They came out perfectly crunchy
5,"The only thing I do differently is, I bake these at 350 for 10 min&apos;s or until light brown on the bottoms. I then cool to a wire rack and freeze until ready for the holiday. I then fill when I&apos;m serving. Great cookie!"
4,I make these cookies every year because my children and their spouses love them. I find them to be a lot of work; chopping the nuts up fine; rolling the dough in balls then dipping them in egg whites then nuts. I triple the recipe because my oldest son can wipe out a batch just by himself. I use almond extract in lieu of vanilla and I use the bottom of a wooden spoon to indent the cookies then I redent them after I remove them from the oven. I have never tried putting the jelly in prior to baking; perhaps I will give it a try this year. Also I use blackberry; grape; and strawberry jelly. Apple hasn&apos;t been as well received when I&apos;ve used it. These are not my favorite cookies because I think they&apos;re more trouble than they are worth but I only make them once a year and my family so loves them and that is what Christmas is all about family and love.
5,I made these cookies for my family and I swear they didn&apos;t even make it 5 minutes and they were gone. They were perfect! Flaky and tender and sweet I will definitely make these again! Oh also I substituted the walnuts with almonds and pecans and used apricot white-cherry jam mmm...now I&apos;m hungry...better make some more!
2,not very sweet....baked them for longer then specified and they still came out too soft...they crumbled easily
4,"HELPFUL TIPS THAT WORK FOR ME: These never go wrong, but I find cookie recipes turn out different as far as thickness by the ingredients and temperatures you use them at.  They turn out SO MUCH BETTER when you use eggs AND butter that are at room temperature.  I always increase the vanilla, and you&apos;ll notice almost all other chocolate chip recipes on here have more as well because it tastes better! :)  I also blend half chocolate chip&half semisweet chocolate chips.  Makes a huge difference in the blend of flavors! MY SECRET: Add 1/8-1/4C andes mint chips in place of some of the cc, and everyone will beg for more!! Always hand mix recipes like this! No mixers or your cookie will be flat!  My husband likes to microwave the cookies a tad & then of course eat w/a glass of milk.  Now my son copies him. :)  Though this is the recipe I&apos;ve turned to for years, when I tried ""Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie"" on here & followed the advice of some reviews ...I switched.  They found the secret to the biggest, chewiest cookie with the right mixture of sweetness!"
2,"I tried everything in the world to get these cookies to not spread.  Adding extra flour made them dry, combining crisco and butter didn&apos;t help and even baking chilled dough didn&apos;t make much difference.  Then...I saw an article in the Sunday paper about why I was having trouble.  This recipe was developed in the 1930s and flour was milled differently back then.  If you use a heavier bread flour and chill the dough for at least 24 hours you&apos;ll have the best cookies ever!  My husband raves about my chocolate chip cookies and so does everyone else who has them.  It&apos;ll be our little secret---ssshhhh!"
5,"I&apos;ve tried many chocolate chip cookie recipes (especially from this website) and my favorite is still the one on the back of the chocolate chip bag!  This is the one I grew up with and the one that I love.
                                
                                I do make one modification.  I use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup butter flavored shortening to keep them puffy."
5,"I grew up near the Toll House in Whitman , MA and have Ruth Wakefield&apos;s original recipe. It calls for butter, not shortening as one reviewer said. This recipe is almost identical, but Mrs. Wakefield dissolved the soda in 1 tsp hot water. Also, the Toll House always chilled the dough overnight to prevent the cookies from spreading too much. This recipe is my favorite choc chip recipe."
1,"NOT cool. These cookies have the worst presentation in the WORLD! SOOOOOOOOOOOOO flat!! I should have added more flour than the recipe called for. Maybe they wouldn&apos;t be so flat. The chips are elevated above the rest of the cookie. This is bad. I will NEVER make these again! Try ""Best Chocolate Chip cookies"" those are my all time FAVORITES! These are just not cool."
5,"These cookies will always be the best!! I always make mine a LITTLE different.. I used 1 crisco butter flavored stick, 2 cups of flour and no nuts.. I cook at 350 degrees and always preheat the oven with the cookie sheet inside so you start off with a warm pan!!"
4,"Made these changes to recipe on the bag
                                Added extra 1/2 tsp baking soda
                                Added extra 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
                                Added extra 1/3 cup flour
                                Used bread flour in place of all purpose flour. 
                                Bake on parchment paper!!
                                Refrigerate dough overnight !!!
                                Used an ice cream scoop to form ping pong ball size scoops
                                Baked at 350 for 14 minutes 
                                These were PERFECT! 
                                Crazy tall and moist. 
                                Absolutely.picture perfect!
                                I pulled all the good ideas off everyone&apos;s reviews."
5,I have been using this recipe to make cookies for my family and my husband&apos;s family for Christmas for over 10 years. Everyone loves these cookies! The only problem I ever had was the cookies used to come out flat. I eliminated this problem by making the dough the night before and leaving it in the refrigerator. I also recently started using parchment paper on my aluminum baking pans instead of baking spray or butter. The cookies come out perfect now and cleaning the pans is a snap. Since parchment paper comes in rolls and tends to curl up it can be a little tricky getting that first batch on the paper (an extra set of hands is very helpful). Once the pan has been in the oven the paper flattens out and is very easy to work with.
4,"Really good chocolate chip cookies- perfect with a glass of milk.
                                I did find however I needed to add about 2/3 cup of flour once everything was mixed in or it was too sticky. Really good once baked."
5,"Best snickerdoodle ever!!! If you&apos;re having a problem with flat cookies, there could be two reasons.  Check your baking soda and Cream of Tartar to make sure they&apos;re fresh.  Baking soda goes flat pretty soon after opening the box.  I start a new box almost every month.  To test it, just put a tiny bit of the soda in some water.  If it doesn&apos;t start fizzing immediately, it&apos;s not any good.  Also, if your eggs are too big the dough will spread too much.  Most recipes call for large eggs, not extra large.  When I make this recipe, I usually pour off just a tiny bit of the egg white, because I like my cookies puffy.  Hope this helps, because I&apos;ve tried a lot of snickerdoodle recipes, and this is by far the best."
5,"HELPFUL TIPS: Bake for 8 min exactly! ...and you can even wait a few min. for it to cool on the cookie sheet just get it out of the oven!  Either way, the critics (my family & friends) RAVED about these yummies, and I&apos;ve never left w/o someone asking for the recipe!  1st: Use butter AND eggs that are room temp. I&apos;ve used all butter w/excellent results. 2nd: Mix dry & wet separately. 3rd: Hand mix or you&apos;ll get a different result.  Do not overmix.  I never have cream of tartar, so I use 2 tsp. of white vinegar OR lemon juice.  Lastly, I used a medium scoop. For the topping, I used 3T. sugar & 3.5 tsp. of cinnamon dumped in ziplock bag.  Do not be afraid to over coat.  It will NOT turn out too sweet (and I&apos;m not a fan of sweets)!!!! Coat well. :) If your cookie turns out flat, I&apos;d check to see if your baking soda has expired.  To test, it should fizzle the second you place it in water.  I&apos;ve never had issues w/these turning out flat OR dough being sticky (which was really confusing to me to hear from others); just keeping them in our lock n lock container long enough before husband comes home.  They store great, & I didn&apos;t have any of the problems many others did!  I never need to put these in the refrigerator first either!"
4,"Yum--love snickerdoodles. I am only giving this recipe 4 stars because I do not like the acrid cream of tartar taste and the way the cookies completely flatten out (I like them puffier).
                                
                                For puffier cookies, I modified the recipe to use 2 tsps of baking powder instead of 2 tsps of cream of tartar, I roll the dough into 1.5"" balls and bake the cookies at 375F for about 8 minutes. I also take the cookies off the baking sheet asap so they don&apos;t have time to heat up and lose their puffiness. Just the way I like them--big, chewy and puffy!"
5,"This is THE best recipe for making snickerdoodles!  I&apos;ve made it at least a dozen times, and I&apos;ve learned a few things along the way:  1) For cookies that are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, bake for only 8 mins. and remove from sheet immmediately to cool on wire rack. You may even want to lower oven temp. slightly. 2) I agree with a previous reviewer that cinnamon/sugar mixture should be increased to 3T white sugar, and 3tsp. cinnamon. 3) For a REALLY quick and mess-free method of rolling balls of dough in cinnamon/sugar mixture, place mixture in a sandwich baggie and drop one ball in at a time to coat. (Thoroughly-coated makes for a tastier snix). Enjoy! And thank you, Beth, for another wonderful recipe! ...Got any ideas for a good sugar/cut-out cookie? ;-)"
5,"these cookies are great.  maybe this is something all you cooks know, but i&apos;m still sixteen and i figured out that if you cream the butter and sugar with an electric mixture, you get a totally different result in texture then when you mix it by hand.  They taste the same but look way prettier if you do it by hand."
5,"FABULOUS recipe.  I have made these before and they were a big hit!  I&apos;m not a big cookie fan, but these are irresistable.  Made a double batch last night in my Bosch, and saved some dough in the fridge to make some more over the next few days.  I forgot to buy cream of tartar after I made them last time, so got to that step & was trying to figure out what to do...when allrecipes.com came to the rescue: I went to allrecipes.com/advice/ref/subs/ and found out that you can substitute 1 t. of cream of tartar with 2 t. of lemon juice or vinegar.  I opted for the lemon juice, and WOW, you&apos;d never know the difference between the recipe with the cream of tartar and the one with the lemon juice!  Just a hint for anyone else in the same predicament :)  Thanks for this awesome recipe, it will be a favorite forever.  Also, to keep your cookies soft, you can add the heal of a loaf of bread to your container of cookies/cookie jar.  Or else lightly spray with water the tops & microwave for 10 secs. or so (time depends on your microwave) to give it that fresh-from-the-oven taste.  Just a tip :)"
4,"This is a great recipe.  I added a 1/4 cup more flour because I know snickerdoodles can be very sticky.  I used a small ice cream type scoop (size 100, the size is on the scrapper bar inside the well of the scoop) and got about 68 cookies.  I baked them at 375 for 8 minutes.  Use parchment paper on your cookie sheets and just slide the parchemnt and all off the sheets to the cooling rack.
                                
                                Another hint is to scoop out all the balls first then roll them in the sugar/cinnamon.  One way to keep them from making a mess of your hands is to wet your hande first.  The dough will not stick to your palms as you roll them.  
                                
                                These do flatten out but are definately a great cookie."
5,"this was an amazing recipe! incredibly easy.. I needed a little more of the sugar/cinnamon mixture than the recipe called for.  When I mixed up the second batch of mixture, I substituted half of the cinnamon for powdered cardamom.   yum!! very tasty as well.  Also, to the people who thought the cookies were too hard:   when the cookies start to look cracked, but the dough still looks wet in the cracks, pull them out -- otherwise, the cookies get too hard."
5,"This is a good recipe, BUT it says to remove cookies off pan immediately--that is impossible unless you overcook them.  I learned this the hard way.  So, cook for the 8 minutes, even if they look underdone, let them rest a couple minutes then remove to cooling rack.  I will make these again."
3,I don&apos;t know what I did wrong but my cookies turned out too flat and not chewy at at all.  I followed the recipe exactly too!
5,"It was perfect exactly as written, and I rarely think that. If I had wanted to add buttermilk and seeds and other junk I would not have looked for EASY coleslaw dressing. My husband loved it. He said, ""now this is good slaw dressing""."
5,"Easy, tasty and what else do you need?
                                And don&apos;t down rate it if you change the entire recipe to suit your tastes.
                                Submit your own recipe!"
5,"This is exactly what it claims to be including the fact that you probably have the ingredients on hand. Easy, quick and tastes good.  And again, please do not rate a recipe to which you&apos;ve made modifications. It&apos;s not accurate to do so. I realize it&apos;s much easier to post your comment with a rating based on your modifications, but it&apos;s simply not right and chokes up the comments, making it more laborious to find a true and accurate rating and review. Get off your duff, write and submit your OWN recipe."
5,"Perfect! just the traditional taste one wants.   if you are doing something different to it, IT IS NOT THIS RECIPE!  Only a jerk  would rate this a 3 star and then proclaim their version a 10 star!"
3,"I rated this as a 3 because it is good, however by adding 1 tablespoon of honey, 2 tablespoons of buttermilk, 1 tbsp. of horseradish w/mustard, and a few shakes of celery seed this makes it 10 stars! Rest assured though if you don&apos;t have buttermilk,celery seed,or honey, it still would serve the purpose."
5,"I rated it a 5 because I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It was great.  We ate it as a side as well as on a bun of  BBQ pulled chicken.  Really good both ways. If I had changed the recipe up, I wouldn&apos;t be rating this particular recipe."
5,"This is a very good basic coleslaw dressing, not too goopy. For one medium bowl of coleslaw, use this recipe at 9 servings, with half a head of finely sliced green cabbage and 2-3 grated carrots."
5,"Super yummy! I made it as is (with a little extra salt by accident) and it was great. I mixed it into a 14oz bag of coleslaw mix and it wasn&apos;t too runny or dry. I was afraid it would be too peppery because I&apos;m not a fan of pepper, but it was well balanced. 
                                On my 2nd helping, I sprinkled a little celery seed on top (because I had some & I love that stuff!) and I liked it even better. 
                                Still, this recipe is great exactly as is and I appreciate that the recipe uses totally normal ingredients every regular cook would have on hand. 
                                Definitely making this again."
5,"I made this several times already, but the first time I made it for my sons graduation party as a side dish. I shredded a whole head of cabbage and 4 medium size carrots. Prepared dressing exactly as stated the day before in frig, using white vinagar, but adjusted servings for 20. Kept dressing in separate container until I was ready to serve. WOW was so good and some of my guests would not leave party till they had the copy of recipe in hands when they left.  There was none left and this wasn&apos;t the only side dish made. I think the key was making dressing the day before and letting the flavors intensify overnight. Loved that it was simple and didn&apos;t need to buy anything to make this."
5,"Yum!  This was my first attempt at making gauc and I was not let down by the high rating on this recipe.  I adapted it a little to my taste by adding more cilantro and garlic and adding some ground cumin.  When choosing your avocados choose ones that are blemish free and have a slight give when squeezed lightly.  There are so many different varities that color is not a good indication.  Sure this has a lot of fat in it, but it&apos;s the good fat that our bodies need to keep are skin supple and our joints lubricated (tell that to my hips!)!
                                
                                07/07/08 Update
                                I just had to update my review on this recipe.  My first review was the first time that I had made this recipe - now I am known for my guac!  I don&apos;t use a recipe any more, but it is similiar to this.  I think the key to delicious guac is lots of garlic and a lot of lime juice.  The lime juice does more than flavor the quac - it keeps it from turning brown.  I also add jalepenios (sp?) seeded, ribbed and finely chopped for a little heat.  Another thing I add is some cumin - one of my favorite spices.  Teh quac I make is chunky, but chunky from the tomatoes, onion and peppers - the avocado I make very smooth.  You don&apos;t want to make this too soon as some discoloration can occur.  I have made it the night before and it&apos;s fine but I prefer to make it a few hours before hand.  That way it stays nice and fresh but the flavors have time to marry.  Regardless of when you make it always flatten the top surface smooth and squirt the jui"
5,"I line in Arizona and my husband and I both love guacamole. We&apos;ve eaten guacamole too many times to count and have made it countless times before. WE BOTH LOOOOVED THIS RECIPE! I followed the recipe exactly and it was THE BEST GUACAMOLE I EVER MADE! My husband is picky about salsa and guacamole, due to his grandmother who makes everything so awesome, but he even said this was the BEST ONE YET! MUST TRY!!! I WILL ONLY MAKE THIS GUACAMOLE FROM NOW ON! Thanks!"
5,"This was excellent!!  When I can find ripe avacados at Costco, I buy them because they come 5 to a package and that&apos;s cheaper than buying them individually.  I scaled the recipe down (using only 1 avacado) because it was just me eating this. Instead of chopping up the onions and garlic, I used onion and garlic powder.  In my opinion, they taste just as good and are much quicker.   I also added a spoonful of salsa to mine.  I love eating this alone with chips or as a side dish to my lunch or dinner.  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitley make again!!"
5,"Great Guacamole! This was everything guacamole should be: smooth and creamy with just the right amount of flavor. Nothing overpowering, nothing artificial, no jarred salas or other oddities to make it some sort of ""creation"". I de-seeded the tomatoes, used red onion and added a little more than 1/4 tsp. of cumin - it went great with warm tortilla chips! This recipe is a definite keeper for sure!!!"
5,"Awesome taste!  It took me longer than 10 minutes to prepare, but it might be that I am just slow at chopping and cutting.  Also, be wary of over mashing the avacado - I thought I didn&apos;t like it chunky, but smooth becomes kinda soupy.  With the whole lime, this doesn&apos;t turn brown for over 24 hours in a sealed container.  Best to eat immediately (or after chilled for an hour), lots of liquid pools in it after a couple days. UPDATE:  Do not freeze this to use at a later time ... the consistency is just strange after thawing and the flavors change.  Still the best Guac, though. :)
                                
                                Thank you for a great addition! :D"
5,"Delicious. NOTES: *I leave out the tomatoes and serve pico de gallo alongside. On the rare occasion there are leftovers, mixed-in tomato makes the guacamole go off faster. Same amount of work, just throw the tomatoes in a separate bowl and toss some extra onion, chili, cilantro, and lime. *Lime acts like salt on the palate, so add salt after the lime juice; you will end up using less. *I always add some ground toasted cumin seed and a seeded jalapeno. *Great with and without garlic. *Reserve half the avocado chunks to add at the end for textural variety. *The most important thing, though, is to use ripe avocados. Buy them a day or 2 beforehand, then let them sit in a brown paper bag on the counter with a ripe apple, pear, or bananas until the avocados are softer. *If the avocados aren&apos;t perfectly delicious, I add a little extra virgin olive oil to the mix."
5,"Excellent! My husband loved it! Fresh Cilantro is a must(.70 cents a bunch). We like chunkier style Guacamole so mashed two of the avocados & chopped the third into very small pieces. These pieces will mush up alittle as you stir in other ingredients, but still give it alittle chunk. If it is still too chunky you can mash it alittle with back of spatula. I will use this recipe on a regular basis. Thanks!"
5,this recipe is easy and delicious! we make it all the time... (and add more cayenne to spice it up) LOVE IT! tip - leave the pits in the container when refrigerating... it&apos;s lasts longer without going brown.
5,add a tbls or two of sour cream
2,"Wow, way too much salt! I think it could have been good with just a 1/2 tsp of salt.  I even used 4 avocados instead of the three mentioned in recipe."
5,"5+++++ I love this recipe. I made some healthy substitutions and it turned out yummy for me. I used whole wheat flour, splenda, and apple sauce in lieu of the oil. I also added about 1 tsp of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon as others have recommended. I followed another users recommendation to seperate the whites from the eggs (beated until fluffy) and folded them into the batter as the final step--turned out nice and fluffy. I served these plain with the cinnamon butter recipe. Also, you can freeze left-overs (if any) in plastic baggies to be taken out at a later time to be quickly reheated in the toaster. 5-star plus--thanks for the wonderful recipe!"
4,"A well above par recipie, crispy and light. If you have a spare minute beat the egg whites separate, then fold them in at the last, not vital but you will not regret it.
                                
                                I also doubled the vanilla and sugar, but the waffles seemed a bit bland still, relying on butter/syrup to bring most of the flavor. A good active-yeast recipe will taste better, but are generally more dense.
                                
                                Also be sure to USE BAKING POWDER, NOT SODA, then the 4 teaspoons called for is perfect, if you put in 4 tsp of soda you&apos;ll never have heartburn again...
                                
                                Bottom line, these waffles are well worth making. Simple, light and almost 5 star good."
5,"This is a great, basic, easy waffle.  My waffle iron sat unused for--literally--10 years.  Wanted to try something new this morning with basic ingredients that I knew I had in the kitchen.  
                                
                                The first waffle didn&apos;t turn out because I didn&apos;t use enough batter--my waffle iron needed about 2/3 cup each--but after that they were perfect.
                                
                                For those new to waffle-making, here is a good tip I have used to know when they are done without having to open the iron constantly to look (which can ruin the waffle if it is still soft)...  It&apos;s done when the waffle quits ejecting plumes of steam around the edges of the iron.  (It&apos;s also usually done when it quits sticking to the iron.)
                                
                                Will definitely make these again -- probably tomorrow!"
3,"HALF THE CALORIES, NO BRAINER!!  These waffles are good BUT...I made easy changes to make HUGE improvements to the nutritional value.  Instead of 2 eggs I used 3 egg whites and I used skim milk made into buttermilk instead of 2% milk (just add 1-1/2T lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes). In place of ½ cup of oil I used fat-free vanilla yogurt.  I agree with other reviews that the recipe as written is a little bland so instead of 1 tbsp white sugar I used ¼ cup Splenda.  I also used 2 tsp of vanilla and about a heaping tsp cinnamon.  I can feel GOOD about serving a 195 calorie waffle as opposed to a 400 calorie waffle - especially when my picky husband can&apos;t tell the difference!"
5,"As is, this is a really good spot on recipe.  Easy to make and enjoyable to eat.  However, with a few modifications it melts in your mouth!  
                                Here are the modifications that I made and yes, this will be redundant because so many other reviewers have done the same thing, AND with good reason!  Yum Yum!
                                Sugar changed 2 tablespoon brown sugar AND 2 tablespoon white sugar
                                vanilla extract changed 1 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
                                Added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon did not want to overpower the flavor of the waffles themselves.  
                                The other changes I did were on the building...
                                The eggs and how they are incorporated.. and yes, again this is redundant because sooo many others have said the same thing and it works to make them light and delicious!
                                seperate the eggs... put the whites in the blender and whip them till they start forming the fluffy whites... then add the yolks on low... then i added the milk, then the vegetable oil allowing to mix before adding the vanilla and all the dry goods (mix them before hand in another bowl).  
                                This helped produce a light waffle that really melted in my mouth YUM!  I will post a pict later of how they turned out."
5,"I will never use another waffle recipe again!  I put all the ingredients into a blender to mix and baked beautiful, light and crisp waffles.  I even used all whole wheat flour, and they were still light and wonderful."
5,"Good recipe, especially because I could make it the night before.  I changed it slightly, separating the eggs and whipping the whites until they were light and fluffy before I mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  I also doubled the sugar and vanilla, as was suggested, and added a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Delicious!"
5,"These are GREAT waffles.  My kids and husband loved them.  They are nice and light and taste good.  EASY to make.  
                                
                                About the review that said they have to much baking soda--oops.  The recipe calls for baking POWDER and if you use Rumford brand there is no bad flavor at all (it&apos;s healthier too).  Just a heads up for those who might not try the recipe based on that review.  
                                
                                This is my new waffle recipe."
5,"Fantastic!!! Hard to find such a fluffy light recipe using whole wheat flour but this is it! I cut oil in half to 1/4 cup, used whole wheat flour instead of white, doubled vanilla, added a sprinkle of cinnamon.
                                I have started to use melted butter for the oil, very good, everyone says they are the best waffles ever."
5,"SUPERB beef stew!  I took the great base recipe, and tweaked it with a compilation of reviewer recommendations.  The end result is a winner, to be sure.  Here is what I did (and I won&apos;t change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt.  Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag.  Shake beef in bag to coat.  Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned.  Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften.  Transfer to slow cooker.  2.  Mix beef broth (I used Swanson&apos;s Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine.  Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker.  3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions:  increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick&apos;s Beef Stew Seasoning.  Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast!  I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread."
5,"I have been making this stew for almost 3 years and wanted to review it again.  Although I&apos;m sure Corinne&apos;s suggestions are good, what I like most about this recipe is the simplicity of preparation...no browning the beef.  I&apos;ve made this over a couple dozen times at least - doubled - and have never had leftovers.  It is a terrific recipe as written."
5,"I made this stew for the first time using Corinne&apos;s suggestion.  The stew turned out great!  The next week, I made the stew following the exact recipe (minus the celery, since I didn&apos;t have any); and I must say that the stew turned out EVEN BETTER when following the exact recipe.  (Also, I didn&apos;t have as many dishes to wash.)  This stew is SO DELICIOUS.  Next time I make this you can bet I will follow the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN."
5,"I don&apos;t understand why Corrine doesn&apos;t just post her own recipe for beef stew.  The point is to review the given recipe, not list a million changes to it.  This stew is perfect AS WRITTEN.  If you make any changes, you are not making this recipe for beef stew!!!!"
5,"THIS is a terrific basic recipe!!  Nothing to stop you from adding your favorite things - although the TASTE is GREAT just like it is.  I used chuck because it&apos;s not as dry as a bottom round.  I had a tomato so I chopped it up & added it.  I saw where someone had added an envelope of beef gravy - great idea too!!!  Thank goodness there&apos;s people out there REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK!!  Oh, and don&apos;t bother to brown the beef the way some recipes state - it only makes the beef dry.  Thanks for this recipe."
5,"An excellent and easy stew recipe. I make minimal changes (I like parsnips, so I add three chopped in place of celery, and I add a little more broth because I like more gravy), but that&apos;s about it. This is one of those easy, homey, stick-to-your-ribs recipes. Some of the reviews tick me off: Yes, it&apos;s a ""regular"" stew recipe because it is, after all, STEW. And all the changes that other reviewers make? Don&apos;t say ""I made this recipe, but I changed EVERYTHING about it."" You aren&apos;t doing this recipe justice.. heck, you aren&apos;t doing THIS recipe at all. I&apos;m as guilty of changing recipes to suit my tastes and pantry as much as anyone, but at least tell us that you&apos;ve made the original recipe as written before doing your million-and-one changes! Thanks for sharing this tasty-as-written recipe, Buchko!"
5,"I made similar adjustments to previous raters.  I dredged the beef in flour/salt/pepper and pan friend until browned in olive oil before adding to the slow cooker.  Then I added some butter and onion to the pan and cooked until softened. Next I deglazed the pan with some of the broth being sure to  scrape up the yummy bits. In total I used 2 10 oz cans of beef broth.  I added 10 oz. sliced button mushrooms. Used almost 2T worchestershire sauce, added a bunch of extra herbs and finally thickened with cornstarch.  It was perfect."
4,"I followed Corinnes suggestions and this came out fantastic! The flavor and cosistency were wonderful, and just as good the next day. 
                                So you dont have to search for it, here is her suggestion: 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick&apos;s Beef Stew Seasoning."
5,"I have this exact recipe in the recipe booklet that came with my slow cooker! I make it all of the time and my family loves it. I use a packet of dry onion soup mix in place of all the spices, only because it&apos;s an easy and convenient way to toss it together."
3,This just tasted like regular old beef stew to me.  Nothing unusual or great about it.  My fiance said there was too much meat and not enough vegetables.  I&apos;ll keep searching for another recipes.  I think this would&apos;ve benefited from a 1/2 c. red wine.
5,"I would recommend NOT making alterations to this soup because the purpose of the set recipe is to lose weight.  I did lose weight when I made this (it was for a vacation), and it tasted great!!  I checked with a local hospital, and they said this recipe is used for overweight patients to get them to lose weight rapidly to prepare for surgery.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone!"
5,"I&apos;ve been making this for my boyfriend for about three months now.  The only thing I do different is to add ground turkey.  He eats a light breakfast of whatever he wants, a light sandwich for lunch and the soup for dinner.  He likes to add some heat in the form of Tabasco or different dried peppers as it heats on the stove EVERY NIGHT.  He&apos;s lost over 50 pounds!  I&apos;m sick of making it, but if it&apos;s working and he&apos;s enjoying it, I&apos;ll keep a pot of it in the fridge."
5,"First of all, a minor caveat-- I&apos;ve never had to diet, since I have a pretty fast metabolism, so I can&apos;t really compare this to other diets. BUT... Several years ago, I started a new job and found myself sending out for fast food for lunch every day, eating it at my desk. All of a sudden, my clothes started to... *shrink*. I stepped on the scxale and saw that I&apos;d gained 15 pounds!!! I panicked!
                                
                                Found this ""diet"" and decided to try it. The weight just went away! It does get a little boring... But it&apos;s tasty and painless; think about adding different spices and/or herbs to the soup to vary it... chili powder, curry, etc. Now, I *did* have to change the way I had lunch once I lost the weight... No more fast food breakfasts and lunches (except for the occasional emergency...), trying to get out and walk a bit a few times a week at lunch... But it did get the weight off and-- with my revamped lunch hour-- kept it off."
4,"This is a very good for you and tasty soup, however, when I used to make this some time ago, I also thought that it lacked something or needed a little more flavor.  To give it the flavor it needs, I decided an old trick my grandmother use to use in her vegetable soup.....add a jar or can of sauerkraut in place of some of the cabbage and it gives it just the zing it needs.  Other than that, I left the recipe pretty much as is, I just didn&apos;t do a whole lot of measuring, just threw it all together and let it cook.  Enjoy!"
5,"I ate this soup for months when the recipe came out years ago.  You have to eat nothing else to lose weight....and I did, about 30 lbs.!!  I gave the recipe to everyone at work and they all lost weight too.  Besides which, it is an excellent soup (not so much for breakfast as we did back then!) but I still like it.  I have added chick peas to the recipe for some protein.  Also some lean hamburger goes well.  Thanks for the memories!"
5,"I make this when I&apos;m looking to lose weight quickly. I tried to follow the recipe as close as I could, adding minced garlic and omitting the canned green beans, but adding more celery and carrot. (Ew. Am I the only person who can&apos;t stand canned green beans?) I also added basil, oregano, thyme and a couple bay leaves. It dosen&apos;t affect the fat burning process to add a little flavor, does it? ;) I used my biggest stock pot and it came right up to the edge. So, plan accordingly. TIP: Make sure you are close to a bathroom about an hour or so after you eat this. This cleans out your system VERY well. EDITED: One pot of this soup lasted me one week, eating it three meals a day. To make it more filling, I add just a little cubed chicken breast. Just in a week, I can feel my pants getting looser. Good stuff. ANOTHER TWO WEEKS LATER: Down ten pounds!"
5,"Very good.  I used my food processor for most of the chopping, adjusted the seasonings to my personal taste, and simmered for a couple of hours.  I froze individual servings and have been bringing it to work for lunch.  It&apos;s very filling.  The only thing I would/will do differently next time is transfer some of the soup to a blender and process until smooth, then add back into the soup for a creamier texture."
3,"The amount of cabbage in this recipe is overpowering. I like cabbage, but this is too much!  If I make this again I will likely only use 1/4 the amount of cabbage and add other healthy veggies like squash and zucchini to make up for it.  I will also cut the recipe in half as it does cook entirely too much... 
                                
                                The thing that makes this soup a ""fat burner"" is you can eat ten bowls in one day and still be below 1000 calories. The carbs are low and there is no fat. If you make variations that don&apos;t include fat, carbs, and calories than you should still have the ""fat burning"" effect of this soup."
5,"LOVE IT!! ADDED FEW SHAKES OF TEXAS PETE HOT SAUCE AND WORCESTERSHIRE AND LEMON-PEPPER SEASONING.  FOR A BURST OF FLAVOR & STILL HEALTHY ADD 1/2LB OF FROZEN,PLAIN (NOT BREADED)OKRA.  ALSO, I DIDN&apos;T COOK THE SOUP TOO LONG...THE VEGGIES WERE STILL AL DENTE AND SLIGHTLY CRUNCHY...SO DELICIOUS.  NO TROUBLE GETTING YOU DAILY QUOTA OF VEGGIES WITH THIS RECIPE...I COULD EAT IT ALMOST EVERY DAY.  OH, DON&apos;T CUT YOUR ONIONS & CARROTS TOO SMALL CAUSE CHUNKIER IS BETTER IN THIS ONE."
3,"I use a little more flavorful breading, 1cup of panko, 1cup of seasoned bread crumbs, and a cup of parmesan cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley, a teaspoon of fresh chopped Thyme and a teaspoon of garlic powder. I brown the chicken in half butter and half olive oil. I also cook some angel hair while the chicken is browning, and put it under the chicken in a casserole dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes, remove foil, add cheese and bake another 10 minutes"
3,"3 stars because this was good with my common sense modifications. I do not know how any one of you got a good result as written. #1 - 4 c. of breadcrumbs?! Whoa! Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to &apos;eye this up&apos; and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded, not &apos;fresh&apos; for best melting result. #6- Don&apos;t put fresh basil on so early. It will burn - leave it for the last 5 min or use dried. Now, with these changes, the dish was delicious - but I guess it is now my own version of chicken parmesan."
5,Great recipe!  Juicy and flavorful exactly as written.
5,"This recipe was really easy to follow & turned out great!  My 1st try at chicken parmesan, total success :-)"
5,"Have to admit if it&apos;s not easy and/or tasty I won&apos;t put the effort in. The WHOLE famiily loved this, and every recipe gets easier each time its&apos; made, right?
                                I only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn&apos;t use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in, and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this, and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great!
                                Given that I had twice as many fillets, next time, I would probably use half the oil, so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.)
                                As much as I loved this recipe, given the calories/fat, I would not make it as often as I&apos;d like.
                                10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner, the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it&apos;s not as crispy, I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk, then cut, trim, and pound with mallet before freezing for later use, this saves lots of time during actual recipe."
4,"Some time ago, I learned a useful trick: instead of steps 3-6 above, after the chicken breasts have been pounded and seasoned as in step 2, lightly brush both sides with heavy 33-35%MF whipping cream (use a pastry brush). Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4, pressing the crumbs into both sides.
                                
                                I now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading, including fish, pork, veal, etc.  It is easier and less messy than using flour, eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well."
5,"All I can say is Wow! I have made chicken parmesan using the most popular recipe from this site, but this recipe blew the other out of the park! This is a no brainer. My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews, does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part, however, made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won&apos;t hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat!"
5,"Incredible dish! Great for dinner guests.  For those folks cooking in high altitude, 15 or 20 minutes is not quite enough to cook the chicken breasts.  You might want to cook them a little longer (6-7 minutes) on top of the stove or microwave them for several minutes (3 minutes)before serving.  Cut them in half to check doneness before serving. If you put them back in the oven for too long, the cheese might burn."
5,"I made this exactly as directed and it was GREAT! So easy and fast - fabulous use of bnls/sknls chicken breast. It came out moist & tender with the crunchy top - perfect. Served it on angel hair pasta with buttered italian bread and it was a hit. Thank you John - your wife is lucky to have you! I love your videos & sense of humor, and your food is excellent! (swoon...get me the fainting couch!)"
5,"This is a great basic Sausage and Gravy! My husband grew up eating this stuff and introduced it to me about 10 years ago. It is a family staple now. A note on the gravy: DO NOT DRAIN THE SAUSAGE. You need the grease inorder to bring the gravy together, adding butter will drastically change the flavor. We use red pepper flakes and toss it in as the sausage is cooking. You can also use the ""hot"" flavored sausage to get an extra layer of flavor. Make sure that you completly stir in the flour and alow it to cook with the sausage and grease for a minute or two before addin the milk, this will take out any ""pastey taste"". Add the milk slowly, I have used skim, 1%, all the way to cream, usually whatever I have on hand. I have found that the less fat your milk has, the less milk you will need to create the gravy! Great on biscuts, toast, cornbread, mashed potatoes, and more...yummmm :)"
4,"I didn&apos;t have Jimmy Dean crumbles but I did have a roll of the ground sausage I used. I couponed a couple days ago and had a few canisters of whomp biscuits so this was perfect for that. I did add a little red pepper flake. Whole skillet? Gone. Great winter snowy morning breakfast. NOTE: For most white gravy mixes, I use equal amounts butter and flour and make a roux in the skillet before I wisk in the milk. It makes for a better gravy."
5,This is exactly how I have been making it and my husband and I love it. Caution... eating biscuits and gravy at resturants will not taste as good anymore. :)
4,"We had this last night for dinner; real comfort food for a cold night.  The only thing I do different is remove the sausage when done and set aside, add 1/4 cup butter to the pan, make the gravy, add back the sausage and often add a fried egg on top, or fry some crushed hashbrowns until crispy to top off the dish."
2,"Cheater&apos;s recipe!  LOL...the instructions for the gravy were good, and I suppose if you are pressed for time, refrigerated canned biscuits are okay....but homemade are so much better, especially since there are recipes for the biscuits that can be mixed the night before and cooked in the morning."
5,We make our own bisquits and use half and half cream instead of the milk. There is no other sausage that we use but Jimmy Dean&apos;s!  The recipe listed is a decent quick peparation. We double our recipe since we always seem to gobble more!
5,"Ever since I started using this recipe years ago, I can&apos;t eat anyone else&apos;s biscuits and gravy (neither can my kids!)  Be prepared to increase the quantity if you have extra people, many will want seconds! Also, stick with Jimmy Dean, (I use the raw ground kind in a tube, HOT is great!) whenever I try a different sausage, I always regret it! I also like to add a couple Tablespoons of butter before the flour.  If you&apos;re like me and only have skim milk in the fridge, you can add a can of FF evaporated milk to make it creamier!  I sometimes make huge batches for big camping parties, Just make at home, freeze in gallon ziplocs and reheat at the campsite (take a big bag of pre-baked bisuits).  Good over scrambled eggs too! Tabasco or Cayenne is a nice condiment for me!  Try these, you&apos;ll find out that it&apos;s easy to make gravy!"
5,"Wow. This was my first time ever making biscuits and gravy and it came out awesome, which doesn&apos;t happen too often when I try a new recipe. I&apos;m 4 months pregnant and have been really craving this so I found some nitrate free Jimmy Dean ground sausage (in the roll) and used Grands frozen buttermilk biscuits. The only downside was that because I used a whole roll of sausage I had to double the recipe and it made tons - guess I&apos;ll be freezing some as my husband won&apos;t eat it. Also, it of course took me longer - about 45 mins to make. I used others suggestions and did not drain the sausage but I did add a pat of butter before the flour. Also, I added the flour slowly and cooked for a bit before the milk, then did the same with that. Great consistency, no lumps! This is just as good if not better than the local diner&apos;s and no nitrates!"
5,This was my first time making biscuits and gravy.  My family loved these.  I may add a bit more flower next time to make the gravy thicker.  Great flavor and easy to make!
4,"This recipe is very similar to another baked ziti recipe that I make, but this one has the addition of the spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese. I only used about 3/4 container of the ricotta, which was plenty enough. I also just eye-balled the red sauce, until it looked like enough (probably a bit more than 14 oz, as my jar of marinara was 24 oz). A good, quick and easy weeknight meal. I divided it into two containers, so I could share with a neighbor."
5,"Great baked ziti recipe...as someone who loves all things with pasta and spinach,  I don&apos;t understand how one reviewer can say sautéed spinach could be tough..
                                This recipe can be modified to include a variety of  veggies.. artichokes, mushrooms, broccoli rabe.. whatever you have on hand"
3,"Well, this is not how you make baked Ziti and pasta is an item you do not have to chew much to digest, Spinach on the other hand takes a lot to chew and can be tough so that would spoil a nice baked ziti. Also, you do not mix it the way they say here..you take all your cheese ingredients and put in a bowl the ricotta, the other cheeses any cheese y ou want add 1/4 of water and one egg and salt and pepper and mix..set aside after your pasta is done drain and take your sauce and put 1.5 cups in the bottom of the pan then add half the pasta and on top of that add half the cheese mixture and toss lightly  add about another .5 cup of sauce and put in the rest of the pasta and more cheese mixture and mix....add to the top grated parm or romano cheese salt and pepper and top with more sauce and put in the oven. do not over  bake if you want spinach serve it on the side."
5,"These were fantastic, but NOT moist!  First, you do not need to dip the fork in sugar when you press these cookies flat.  They are sweet enough!  Don&apos;t press the cookies flat if you don&apos;t like thin & crispy cookies.  Leave them in little balls for thicker and more chewy cookies. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter and then divided it into 3 bowls.  In one, I added 1/3 cup of raisins, in another, 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and in the last one, I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and 1/4 cup of shredded coconut.  They needed a full 10 minutes to bake and they were all DELICIOUS!!!"
5,"This recipe makes a great cookie! You can tailor it to your liking: take them out a bit early for softer cookies, or bake them a little longer for a crisp cookie. I divided the dough and added raisins to one batch; chocolate chips to the second; and Craisins & white chocolate to the third, which were absolutely delicious! Of course, they were great without adding anything. I did reduce the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves which gave them an even better taste. Also, I didn&apos;t grease the pan, chill the dough, or flatten w/fork and they turned out just fine. Try it for yourself!"
5,"Wow!  I loved these cookies and they were super easy to make.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.  WW flour in place pf white flour and added raisins.  I also took the advice of another eviewer and left them round instead of flattening them with a fork and the came out round, soft and perfect.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe."
5,"True to their name, these cookies were quite soft, and tasty too!  I didn&apos;t find it necessary to refrigerate the dough, and rolling it into balls was too time-consuming.  I just made your basic drop cookies using a spoon.  I also tried flattening some using a fork dipped in sugar, but it really didn&apos;t make a difference.  In my opinion, you can just skip that step.  I will definitely make these again!!"
5,"These were great! the first time i made oatmeal cookies and a total success. i chose this recipe cos it said &apos;soft&apos;, which is what i wanted and they really are - lovely and moist, chewy and with v.good oatmeal flavour. changed a few things - added 1 1/2 cups raisins, so cut white sugar to 2/3 cup so they wouldn&apos;t be overly sweet. next time might try cutting to 1/2 cup cos i dont think the cookies need the extra sugar. also used margarine instead of butter. unfortunately realised that i didn&apos;t have enough cinnamon (only about 1 small teaspoon!) so next time i&apos;ll make sure i have the right amount. found this dough really easy to work with. had to knead the raisins in by hand cos it was too thick to stir, but that was ok. after chilling it rolled really easily into balls without being sticky! i baked the cookies on parchment paper, and made 30. baked for 8 minutes - they come out looking way too doughy, but give them 5 minutes and they firm up to perfection! tip - i found that these cookies do not spread and flatten much by themselves, so i&apos;d advise anyone to flatten the balls a lot before putting them in the oven. i&apos;ll be making these again and again!! :)"
5,"This is the best oatmeal cookie recipe I&apos;ve had yet.  I can&apos;t put my finger on what separates this one from the rest, but the ingredients are the perfect combination for a great tasting cookie.  Crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle, with a perfect blend of spices.  I can&apos;t wait to try them with raisins and various flavors of chips (chocolate, butterscotch, and cinnamon).  Thanks for a great recipe."
5,"The perfect oatmeal cookie. No rocket science here--simple to mix, simple to bake, great results. Bake longer for chewier, shorter time for softer cookies, add nuts or raisins if you like or just as is. Nice oatmeal flavor with just a hint of cinnamon and not overshadowed by a ton of spices. Just that simple."
5,"After reading other reviews I subtracted 1/2 cup of sugar, and I was sorry I did.  They were still delicious, but next time I will use the full amount of sugar.  The cookies even stayed soft for 4 days (that&apos;s when everyone finished them). Excellent recipe!!!"
5,"Outrageously delicious! I cut the amount of oats to 2 cups to make them more chewy and thin + some chocolate chips for the Mrs. She doesn&apos;t usually have a sweet tooth for cookies &apos;n cakes, but these - I had to fight vigorously to get my share!"
2,"Easy, good but not the best recipe for raisin-less oatmeal cookies.  I&apos;ll try these again sometime and see if I just didn&apos;t get it right the first time.  It might be the cinnamon, but we usually love cinnamon. Also way too salty.  Thanks for the recipe."
5,"This was my first attempt ever at gingerbread.  I refrigerated it for 1.5 days because I got busy, and the dough kept well wrapped in plastic wrap.  YUMMY flavor--my 2.5-year-old and I both love them!  I didn&apos;t have enough molasses on hand, so I used probably about 2 Tbsp of corn syrup to make up for what I was missing.  It didn&apos;t seem to cause a problem.  For the other gingerbread virgins out there, here is my advice: first of all, when you take the dough out of the fridge, it will seem rock hard.  Don&apos;t panic, it softens as you roll it.  Only roll out 1/2 at a time as it gets very soft, very fast.  Second of all, don&apos;t forget to MOVE the cookies to a wire rack after 1-2 minutes as listed.  I got busy with my toddler and forgot, and my first batch stuck pretty good to my cookie sheets.  I had to be careful to not crack them to pieces when removing them.  With the next batches, I removed them after 1 minute with no problems at all.  Happy baking!"
5,"Exactly what I was looking for. The taste and texture are great and the dough is SO easy to work with. After making 8 batches of sugar cookies it was so nice to move to this dough which rolled and sliced so easily. I am an expert baker and I really love this dough! You can up the spice if you are looking for something super spice-laden, but this one is great for kids. A tip for molasses: spray the measuring cup with cooking spray and the molasses just slides right out!"
5,"This fantastic recipe is a favorite of my cooking students!  The balance of spices and flavors is perfect and the ""men"" turn out just right each time we make them.  To complete this recipe in 1.5 hours we patted the dough onto a Corelle dinner plate and put it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.  This thinner layer of dough chills quickly making the men easy to roll out and cut."
5,Made these last Christmas. Easy and delicious.
5,"This recipe is delicious and the dough was easy to work with! To avoid rolling out the dough too many times and inevitably adding more flour, I separated the dough into 3 flattened disks before wrapping and refrigerating them. After an hour, I took the dough out of the fridge and rolled out each disk until they were the right thickness (for me, about half a centimeter). I then re-wrapped each disk in plastic and refrigerated them overnight. The next day, I simply unwrapped the disks, placed them onto my floured counter and cut out the gingerbread men!"
5,I don&apos;t cut these out or chill the dough. I roll the dough into small balls and roll in sugar. I use a small glass dipped in sugar and flatten them out. I bake them right away and call them Molasses cookies.I wanted a recipe that called for butter and not shortening.This recipe turned out great.
4,Just to add to my last review - I cooked the cookies for about 5 minutes longer making them crunchy rather than soft. The molasses aren&apos;t so overpowering anymore. Now I can&apos;t stop eating them! I would use less molasses more cinnamon.
5,Excellent just as written. My personal preference is a slightly puffed (no spread) cookie with a little bit of a spice kick. Therefore for my second batch I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup increased the ginger to 2 tablespoons the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon and added a teaspoon of ground cloves. This recipe is fabulous.
1,I have tried this recipe twice and both times the dough turns out very dry and crumbly. I would not recommend this recipe.
4,"I&apos;m constantly asked to make my version of this recipe.  Here&apos;s what I do differently that I think makes it better.
                                
                                1. No onions.  (I think they just get in the way of the potato and cheese flavor)
                                2. Make extra cheese sauce (I think an extra half recipe of sauce will do it)
                                3. Put extra cheese in the sauce.  (at least an extra half cup, but to your taste)
                                4. Layer cheese sauce between layers of potatoes.  (make sure to grease the pan well or it&apos;s hard to get off after baked)
                                5. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top for extra crispiness.
                                
                                I made two huge pans of this for a party with 30+ people and it all went.  Definitely a favorite of mine."
5,"Made exactly as directed, only change being mincing the onion instead of rings, as I don&apos;t like the texture of onions in large chunks. One reason I chose this recipe was because I prefer whole, natural foods (avoiding processed cheese and cans of soup, for example), and it fit the bill for that well enough. Verdict: it&apos;s quite possibly the best cheesy-potato side I have ever tasted. Some reviewers have called it bland, but I prefer to term it comfort food. It&apos;s a creamy, cheesy, potato side dish. It doesn&apos;t have to have a special bite or kick to it, or evoke any particular area of the world. I adore all sorts of cuisines—Thai, Middle Eastern, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, you name it—but once in a while a lightly seasoned dish that lets you taste the potato, the cheese, the simple flour-and-milk sauce...once in a while that simplicity is the pefect complement to your meal."
5,"Can you say.......disappeared faster than a speeding bullet?  I just made this as a side dish to my Christmas ham.  I doubled the recipe...used a lot more pepper than expected....used Cracker Barrel&apos;s Vermont extra sharp white cheddar ..... sauteed the onions with some garlic and butter before adding to layers....and slow cooked in crock pot (oven was full of ham).  WOW!!!  This recipe rocked.  I loved that it was so user friendly and easy to cook in the crock pot.  It is a must have to choose side dishes that can cook in a crock at the holidays.  Thank you 1,000 times over!!!!!!!"
4,"I thought this recipe was very, very good.  I will not make Au Gratin Potatoes from a box mix again!  I&apos;m rating it 4 stars instead of 5 because I feel a few simple changes are needed.  I would mince the onion and mix it throughout the potatoes.  We did not care for the big, slimy rings of cheese-covered onions in the center of the dish, although we did like the flavor of the onions.  Also, a 1 quart casserole dish is too small for this recipe, use at least a 2 quart.  Another tip, which I&apos;m sure many people are already aware of, is to spray the foil with a bit of cooking spray before putting it on the dish to keep the potatoes and cheese from sticking to it.  Finally, we like our potatoes to be golden brown on top, therefore I removed the foil for the last 15 - 20 minutes of cooking time.  Thanks for a very good recipe that we will enjoy many times over!!"
5,"I was hesitant to make this but all the raving reviews had me curious.  My family of 5 raved about these potatoes all through dinner, my husband said they&apos;re the best he&apos;s ever had! I added extra cheese as we are cheese fans.  I usually make mine by just adding shredded cheese, onion, flour and milk and bake which is delicious but these beat it!  Also a great tip, this is the same cheese sauce my family uses for homemade mac n cheese, if you use this recipe and pour it over cooked elbow macaroni and add extra shredded cheese on top then bake just a bit to melt, it&apos;s the best mac n cheese you&apos;ve ever had! You could make a double batch and have the mac the next night with baked chicken.  Thanks Cathy"
5,"This was easy and delicious! I sliced then microwaved the potatoes for about 8 minutes to cut down on baking time. Then poured the cheese sauce over top and mixed with potato slices, then bake."
4,"Good recipe, nice as a side w/baked ham.  Modified slightly by sauteeing onions 1st w/a bit of fresh/minced garlic for 4 min to reduce ""raw"" onion taste B4 adding to layers. Also agree to remove cover 15 min B4 serving to get a little crust or add a little buttered breadcrumbs to get a light topping. Convert this side dish recipe to a ""one meal"" casserole by adding left over chunks of ham (from a previous meal). This casserole is then yummy as brunch, lunch or supper."
4,"Creamy, saucy and delicately flavored potatoes which are the perfect accompaniment to more robustly seasoned meats. Would be better, however, with onions chopped rather than sliced, and to uncover for the last 20 minutes to brown the top."
5,"My husband and I loved this so much... My makin them out of the box days are over... I made just a couple changes... I sprinkled garlic powder on both layers of the potatoes...I also used marble cheddar and after I  poured the cheese mixture over I also topped it off with a bit more shredded cheese... I baked it covered like it said but uncovered it for the last 10 minutes and it gave it just the right amount of crispiness, just the way we like it... and for my husband I added just 1 more sprinkle of cheese to his on his plate... These are also great the next day served with eggs for breakfast...   
                                Kiki (Brampton,On,Canada) P S.. I wanted to add that I just made this again today (Oct 4th) and topped it off with some cooked and crumbled turkey bacon and sliced green onions.. Fabulous!!!"
3,"Good overall, but on the bland side. Found the onions sliced into rings changed the overall texture and appearance of this dish.  Also, potatoes sliced at 1/4 inch were not done at 1.5 hours.  Perhaps diced onions vs sliced would have been a better fit which is why I am only rating this 3 stars."
5,"The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it tasted great but was too dry. So I doubled the sauce, used a deep dish pie plate, reduced the temp to 375 & baked for 45 minutes. It was perfectly moist without being runny, and the pie shells were perfectly done. Absolutely fabulous! Goes without saying it is a keeper!"
5,"After reviewing several ratings I made some recommended changes. The first being I added more seasoning (garlic pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning) to the sauce and to the chicken mixture before cooking. Also, I cooked the chicken and veggies in chicken stock instead of water. My husband doesn&apos;t like celery so I used potato instead and also added some corn. I used Pillsbury ready made pie crusts (so easy..just open and unroll). And after brushing with egg white, baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes. I doubled the sauce and added most to the chicken mixture before putting it into the pan.  I baked on 375 for 40 minutes. It looked and tasted delicious!!"
5,"I&apos;m giving this recipe 5 stars for the way it turned out after my modifications, without them I doubt it would have been as good.  I took a lot of the previous suggestions, and I boiled my veggies in chicken broth (just added a boullion cube) although I didn&apos;t use peas (can&apos;t stand them) and just boneless, skinless breast meat. I used 3/4 cup of onion, and subbed 1/2 tsp garlic powder for celery seed (didn&apos;t have any).  I drained the broth from the veggies, and used 2 cups in the pan, and after I added everything into the crust, I poured about another 1/4 cup of broth in with everything (as other reviewers complained it was too dry).  Cooked for 30 min in a gas oven, and it came out perfect! Will definitely make again.
                                
                                edited to add: I also made this with 3 small, cubed potatoes, and it made it even better."
3,"Boil the chicken and veggies? For 15 minutes?  And then throw the broth away?  Then add canned broth?  Really?  Is that how to do it?  I suggest sauteeing the chicken pieces, celery and onion together, adding the frozen veggies, add the broth, spices and mix the flour with a little water to add and thicken the mixture."
5,"This was SO delicious, the best I have ever tasted.  I made it with the ""Butter Flaky Pie Crust"" and it turned out perfectly flaky and wonderful.  I pre-baked the bottom crust for 6 minutes, doubled the black pepper, added a tsp. of poultry seasoning and garlic salt and a diced potato.  I added an extra 1/4 c each of milk and broth to combat any dryness.  It turned out SPECTACULAR and was a huge hit with the family...they even ate it for breakfast.  Will definitely make this again."
4,"I am not a ""pot pie"" fan but made this for my guy yesterday. Took the advice of others and used a rotisserie chicken, added poultry seasoning and garlic powder, etc. Also used frozen deep dish pie shells. Next time I will mix the filling and gravy together before putting it in the shell. I couldn&apos;t get the liquid to seep down through which caused the filling to be a bit too dry. I also think it needed a little bit more salt so will use garlic salt rather than powder next time. It was still pretty good considering my distaste for ""pot pies"". Definitely think mixing the filling with the liquid is the answer.  Update:  made this again but used frozen mixed veggies in addition to a cubed potato and the onion. Made extra gravy (about 1/2 more) and mixed with the filling before putting in the pie shell. Really helped the dryness.   Yet another update: Made this again using phyllo puff pastry in ramekins and wow is it good! Perfect size for the grand kids who loved it!  We also froze some and took to work for lunch - takes about 5-7 minutes in the microwave! Note:  I always have L.B. Jamison&apos;s chicken soup base on hand and add a spoonful to chicken & noodles, chicken soup, this recipe and others.  Really brings out the flavor!"
5,"This was AMAZING! My family kept raving how good it was. Like others before me, I boiled the veggies and the chicken in the chicken broth. When the chicken was done I saute&apos;d it in butter with garlic, onions, salt and pepper. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup because I needed more gravy. There was so much meat and veggies that I put it in a 9x13 pan and topped it with two pilsbury already made dough. I brushed the top of the dough with egg white and it came out so wonderful! What a recipe. I will be making this again and again.
                                
                                Update - I made this with left over roast from last nights meal and it was amazing. I used beef broth and also a jar of beef gravy so we&apos;d have extra. My kids liked it better then the chicken pot pie."
5,"I&apos;ve been making this for years now, and I&apos;ve adjusted the recipe as follows: 1) I double the sauce recipe as others suggest, 2) I add in poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and chili powder to the sauce to taste, 3) I just use a 16oz package of frozen mixed veggies and a diced potato. I boil these in broth with the chicken, 4) After the sauce has thickened, I dump the chicken and veggies (after draining) into the saucepan and stir it all together before putting it in my pie.
                                
                                Doubling the sauce and adding extra veggies gives me a little leftover filling when I do a regular deep dish pie (I&apos;m ok with this though, as I happily eat the filling on its own). However, usually I make 2 dozen mini pies in my muffin tin, cooking for 20 minutes. I love these mini pies because I&apos;m constantly on the run and can eat them with one hand without a fork and knife!"
5,This recipe was wonderful! It definately puts the frozen pot pies to shame.  I only did one thing differently after reading others reviews saying that the bottom crust was soggy.  I beat an egg white and brushed it on the bottom crust before putting in the filling.  It worked great! I also brushed it on the top crust as well.  It was SO delicious!
5,"I&apos;ve made this recipe at least 10 times and I absolutely love it!  People I&apos;ve made them for can&apos;t get over how good they are!  A friend told me they are WAY better than any candied nuts she&apos;s bought at stores/festivals, etc.  For a pound of nuts, I only use 1/3 C of sugar as I don&apos;t believe in using much sugar in anything.  They are PLENTY sweet with that amount!  I also add a t. of vanilla extract to the wet mix!  YUM!!!!!  I&apos;ve never tried walnuts but I am right now...they are currently baking.  Will let you all know how it turns out!"
5,"It was DELICIOUS! I changed some things, though. Instead of water, I used vanilla extract. I also lowered the sugar amount to 2/3 cup-- 1/3 being regular white sugar and the other 1/3 brown sugar. The first time I did this, I didn&apos;t lower the salt amount, and it tasted like a salty-sweet snack. They were delicious! This time, I&apos;m lowering it to maybe half a teaspoon for a sweeter taste. You can&apos;t go wrong with this recipe!
                                
                                UPDATE: I lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp as recommended by some users, and I definitely recommend it."
4,I thought these were very good with the sugar reduced A LOT.  1 Cup sugar for a pound of nuts just seemed like to much to me.  I used just a bit less than 1/3 cup sugar and it was more than enough.
5,"As is, this recipe makes a delicious candied nut. There&apos;s no need to change anything -- the amount of sugar and salt are perfect. But if you want to kick it up a couple of notches, here are a few suggestions:
                                - As mentioned before, replace the water with vanilla.
                                - Add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. The unexpected heat makes people go crazy for them! 
                                - After you mix the nuts in with the egg mixture, remove them from it using a slotted spoon and then toss them into the sugar mixture. All of the excess egg is not necessary. 
                                BTW, this recipe works with mixed nuts, as well, but pecans are best. Enjoy!"
5,"Everyone at work raves about how delicious these are! I double the batch using 2 pounds of pecans, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 egg whites, but then I make some changes:  I replace the water with 2 tablespoons of vanilla, I also cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and only use 1.5 teaspoon of salt.  My co-workers beg me to bring these in when we do our monthly pitch-in lunches."
5,"Out. Stand. Ing.  Addictive and dangerous, as well. I followed the recipe to the letter, eschewing the addition of vanilla or playing around with the amount of sugar and salt.  If you follow the recipe to letter, you will be elated with the results.  Try it once as is, if you feel they&apos;re not insanely perfect, then I guess start making additions, subtractions or substitutions.  I certainly won&apos;t .  They&apos;re a perfect 10 and would make a very welcome gift for special occasions or the holidays.  Helpful hint:  to coat with sugar mixture, place sugar in a large plastic bag, add egg wash coated pecans and shake the bag to coat them.  Each piece will come out evenly coated."
3,The recipe and directions are overall great. I recommend either omitting the salt all together or decrease the amount to 1/4 teaspoon. An entire teaspoon makes this treat more salty than sweet. I also replaced the water with a teaspoon of vanilla. I never understood the use of water when you can replace it with flavor. And I still had plenty of wet mix to coat the pound of pecans.
5,"Sooo good! I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and they were lightly sweet and perfect for us! Will make them often, specially to add to couple  spinach and goat cheese salads that we like from this site, mmmmm!"
5,"This is a great and simple recipe! I read all the reviews first to see what people did different, and I did them all plus my own twist.
                                First I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup, and added honey! Replaced the water with vanilla, same amount of cinnamon, a dash of water,NO SALT but what I did different is instead of mixing the sugar mix separate i just added it in when the pecans were coated with the egg mix.  Then to give it a good twist for the adults I added a cap full of whiskey and vodka. 
                                Such a great snack for everyone, naturally for children leave out the alcohol but still a great snack. Believe me by adding the alcohol gives it a different sweet taste, can&apos;t wait to do this again!"
5,"Great recipe, with ONE exception: I initially followed the directions to whisk the flour/eggs then add the wet ingredients, but this left me with VERY lumpy unusable batter. Doing the reverse - mixing the eggs & wet stuff then sifting in the flour - worked way better."
5,"BRILLIANT BASIC CREPES.
                                This is a scrumptious recipe for thin, delicious German style pancakes. I&apos;m a professional musician and recording artist, and I often find myself in the kitchens of recording studios, trying to make something edible from the staple ingredients studios keep in their kitchens. Well, this recipe is it!!! Everyone has milk, eggs, salt, butter, and flour in their kitchen, and these babies whip up like a charm! Even the batter will keep in the fridge for a few days. Personally, I like to throw in about a third cup of granulated sugar and a quarter cup of powdered sugar to make them sweet and a little crispy around the edges. Just be sure to put a fresh dab of butter in the pan before pouring the batter each time. I&apos;ve tried countless pancake/crepe recipes, and nothing really impressed me until this one. I recommend it most enthusiastically!
                                
                                Christine Anderson"
5,"MMM! best crepe recipe ever! one of my favorite breakfast recipes! I often make an apple cinnamon mixture (fry together 1 tbsp butter, 1 apple chopped fine, a pinch of each cinnamon and nutmeg, and 1 tbsp powdered sugar, until apple pieces are soft.) and roll it inside the crepes! Delicious!"
5,"I had a hard time wrapping my brain around the flour + eggs, then other ingredients....so I just did what I always do....wet stuff blended, then dry stuff added to it. They have turned out great every time I have made them. A touch of sugar and vanilla makes great sweet crepes...some pepper and herbs make great veggie crepes. BOTH are great for breakfast! I almost always double or triple this recipe, and it keeps well in the fridge."
5,"super recipe! I live in Europe and got tired of buying the already prepared just add water mixes so I tried this one out! REALLY REALLY easy!
                                I find a good trick if using a non stick pan is to shake it back and forth with the handle now and then- when the crepe begins to slip back and forth it is done on the primary side so you flip and really quickly do the other side or it gets rubbery."
5,"Wonderful!  Two modifications: 1 t vanilla, and more water until the batter was ""crepe"" consistency."
1,"Someone tell me what I did wrong please! I prepared the batter from the previous suggestions and it came out beautifully, no lumps, but when I put it in the well-oiled pan, it just turned into scrambled eggs!  I had to throw it out!  It can&apos;t be the recipe because all of these reviews, so maybe it was the pan, the spatula.......I don&apos;t know!  Help! (SMILE)"
5,"I used this recipe for my french class for our Christmas party. I added to it thawed strawberries--whole and sliced, melted semi-sweet chocolate (and some unmelted on top!!), and a frosting consisting of powdered sugar, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla extract. It was such a hit, there were no complaints and the other teachers who got in on our festivities enjoyed them as well!!!!!"
5,"My children love these!
                                I too added Orange peel and Grand Marnier(SP?).
                                I also let the batter sit for a couple of minutes after all the ingrediants were mixed together!
                                We had them with powdered sugar and diffrent flavored jams!
                                TO DIE FOR!!!

5,"Wow! I was surprised at how good these are! Some tips: I used an 11x17"" jelly pan. Line the bottom & sides with foil & lightly spray the foil with non-stick spray. Generally, sticking is not a problem but I did have a problem with the foil stuck in the toffee where I had a seam in the foil. (I probably should have folded the two pieces of foil together instead of just overlapping them.) DO NOT use a pan with no sides. You don&apos;t want this stuff boiling all over in your oven. Feel free to cover the entire bottom with saltines. (If you use only the 4oz package, they will spread throughout the whole pan anyway as they boil in the oven.) Also, before you start timing the 3 minute boil, make sure it&apos;s truly boiling. Start timing once you see bubbling foam all around the edges. When you pour the boiled sugar mixture, don&apos;t worry about getting every section of the salines covered. Once you put it in the oven, it boils like crazy so the entire cracker gets covered. Finally, I think the milk chocolate chips would have been better than semi-sweet. (I love Swiss Colony toffee!) This is almost as good except I get to take credit for it!"
5,"Pretty good!! Here&apos;s my suggestions:  Bring to a boil on medium high and then allow to boil for the full 3 minutes without stirring.  Space the crackers so they have some gaps between them.  When the chocolate is put on, spread it with a spatula as if you were frosting each, then place in the oven for another minute to melt more, then add nuts.  Let the cookies sit for about 20 minutes at room temperature and then break apart (they will not be set up all the way) into the individual crackers.  Trim the edges with a knife and save the crumbs for ice cream or next time.  Finally, let them chill for awhile in the freezer before storing.  This way they come out looking nice enough to present--but they taste great no matter how you do it."
5,"Very good! I used the saltines with the unsalted tops (not unsalted saltines, just no salt on the tops). You probably need a little salt to give the flavor contrast. Crisp, buttery, toffee-y (not a word) flavor. The chocolate and pecans put it over the top. To the cooks that had gooey results, you may not have boiled the mixture long enough, or, baked it long enough for that matter. Also, DO NOT STIR when it&apos;s boiling. I really think you do need to use DARK brown sugar for that true toffee taste. Piece-o-cake recipe, makes a lot for a little $$$, and people will be surprised when you tell them (if you do ;-) that you made it with saltines. Be sure to line a cookie pan with sides (jelly roll pan) with foil, and spray with a non-stick (I used butter flavor) spray prior to laying the saltines down. Easy clean up, and great for gift giving. You could also use almonds for that true toffee experience. I toated the pecans lightly beforehand. A treat to satisfy that simultaneous cookie/candy craving (read: Twix bar). Thanks, Tracy!"
5,"I needed to take cookies to a COOKIE EXCHANGE that we were having with our office staff today.  I saw these cookies, the reviews were great and they seemed novel and very fun to try.  Well, to make a long story short, I made them WITHOUT the saltines.  FIRST, I mixed 5 cups of miscellaneous ingredients -- Cherrios, Rice Chex, Pretzels, Raisins, Mixed Nuts, and Coconut spread out in a shallow layer on my cookie sheet.  Then I proceeded exactly the way the rest of the recipe said.  They were absolutely fantastic and everyone gobbled them down.  A little salty and a little sweet.  This would be a perfect basic recipe to use up all the bits and pieces of ingredients that you have in the cupboard.  Tastes different each time!  So all in all this recipe is a keeper.  It is yummy and versatile at the same time."
5,"This has just been the hugest hit in our family.  My daughter stole it from me, and now her husbands family is crazy over it.  We played around a bit too.. we did two batches of the carmel sauce - made a layer of saltines, poured it over, sprinkled toffee chips, layered another saltine, poured the rest of the carmel, baked it 5 minutes, then sprinkled ghhiradelli&apos;s semi-sweets and cashews.  When the chocolate was warmed, started in one corner and swiped back and forth in zigzags.  It made the most beautiful presentation.  At our get-together with friends, my two batches were the only empty dish at the buffet. ;)  *Just wanted to add that we used Reynolds Release foil, worked a charm.  Awesome Tracy, thank you so much for this recipe!"
5,"DO NOT STIR THE BUTTER AND BROWN SUGAR WHILE IT BOILS!!!!!!  I have never made toffee before and I didn&apos;t know this.  It really should say this in the recipe because they don&apos;t turn out like toffee skor bars...more like carmel.  They are chewy.  I was so disappointed that after I read reviews and realized not to stir the butter and brown sugar (I stirred it a lot, afraid it would burn) I decided to make another half batch just to make sure that was the problem.  I also baked them for 7-8 minutes compared with my 4-5 on the first batch.  THEY ARE INCREDIBLE, AS LONG AS YOU DON&apos;T STIR!!!!  I wish I had known.  These taste like Skor candy bars.  I sprinkled just a tiny bit of finely crushed pecans on top and they are delish!"
5,"These were excellent!!  No joke.  My son and his friend thought they were from See&apos;s.  I used light brown sugar and no nuts.  I used an entire sleeve of saltine crackers; I lined the baking pan with half the crackers and crushed the remainder in my hands and sprinkled them over the whole crackers.  I did this because of some of the reviews I had read about these being a little greasy.  The additional thickness of the crackers soaked up the butter perfectly.  Next time I will probably crush all the crackers, so they are easier to cut into a variety of shapes.  I will absolutely make these again and again.  They were AWESOME!!"
5,"So easy and addictive!  I used a 9x13"" non-stick pan and used only 3/4 cup light brown sugar and 3/4 cup butter.  I tried 1/2 cup each, but it didn&apos;t create enough of the toffee layer.  After spreading the chocolate chips I let it harden at room temperature.  It takes about 2 hours and then I use a metal spatula to cut the bars.  I tried putting them in the fridge the first time I made them, but when I started cutting them, the chocolate layer separated from the toffee layer.   Then when I&apos;m done cutting them, then I put them in the fridge.  Thanks for the recipe!"
5,"I am begged to make these every year! Kids, neighbors, coworkers etc. I have read the reviews and have picked up some helpful tips. Here are my 2 cents.I use Heath Bar chips (instead of pecans) on mine and it takes it to another level. I make about 10 pans of this every Holiday.
                                
                                !. Must have non stick foil wrap. YES NON STICK KIND.
                                
                                2. Use your timers!
                                
                                3. Don&apos;t touch the butter and brown sugar mixture once it starts boiling. Boil for three minutes.
                                
                                4. I use heath bar chips (located in baking aisle)Once the mixture comes out of the oven I sprinkle them over the bubbling mixture and then put back into the oven for 2 mins. 
                                
                                5. Then I take it out and sprinkle the semi sweet chocolate chips on it aprox. 1 cup. Let it sit on there for two minutes or so and when soft I spread it around. I used to put the chocolate chips on then put back into the oven and for some reason it makes them hard to spread. Just let the heat of mixture soften them.
                                
                                6. Buy a silicone spatula. It does make a difference
                                
                                7. Let it sit out for at least 30 mins before putting in fridge. This lets it absorb into the cracker."
1,"I must have done something very wrong.  I was so disappointed with the way these turned out after reading all the five star reviews.  It tasted and looked just like a saltine cracker with chocolate and nuts on top.  If they are done right, are you supposed to recognize the cracker on the bottom?  Mine looked like a saltine cracker with all its little holes and ridgey edges.  What did I do wrong?  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll waste the butter, chocolate and especially the nuts on these again."
5,"This recipe is great! I dries hard like it should. But i actually added another cup of powdered sugar to get the consistency i wanted. (as is it comes out runny) I also added a tsp of vanilla instead of the lemon, and it still came out good. I will definately use this recipe again and often!"
5,"I used this icing to put together a gingerbread house (made with real, heavy gingerbread) and it worked wonderfully!  It hardens quickly so your house will stay together, but you need to keep it in an icing bag or covered so it doesn&apos;t dry out in the bowl.  Oh, I also left out the extract, which doesn&apos;t change the icing at all except for the taste."
5,I used this icing on rolled sugar cookies with great results. Yes it was a little runny but rather than adding more powdered sugar I just used my pastry bag with a small round tip to pipe the icing over the top of each cookie creating a beautifully finished look when dry. The icing took a few hours to dry completely but was indestructable after that. Stored/froze well and tastes yummy; the lemon adds a nice flavor!
5,"This is a good recipe.  If it&apos;s coming out runny it&apos;s because you&apos;re not beating it enough.  I let my mixer go for 5 minutes and beyond until I get peaks. It&apos;s shiny and tastes good too.  By the way, did you know you can actually freeze royal icing?  Just thaw and beat again and it works great."
5,This was a great icing recipe...I was looking for a keeper to use with my sugar cookies (The Best Rolled Sugar Cookies from this site by the way are the BEST...) This recipe worked GREAT with the pasteurized egg whites that come in a carton from the egg section I was making cookies for my daughters pre-school class so regular raw egg whites were out of the question. I did add a 5th cup of powdered sugar as I wanted a stiffer icing. Worked and dried beautifully...thanks!
4,As others have mentioned it&apos;s a bit runny. If you&apos;re using it as gingerbread house glue don&apos;t put it on too thickly or else it takes very long to dry (just like real glue)! I&apos;m thinking that it would be best to use this icing mostly as glue and then maybe a fluffier icing for decorative iced accents. As far as decorating gingerbread cookies though it worked quite nicely! You can dip them in it (like someone mentioned for biscotti) or decorate them with it or both. I posted a photo of my cookies and the initial stages of our very-sloppy gingerbread houses in my Cook&apos;s Photos.
5,"This is a great recipe.  I used 1/2 cup pasteurized egg whites from a carton. If your icing is too thin, it&apos;s not because you do not have enough powdered sugar, it&apos;s because you need to beat this type of icing for A LONG TIME.  I beat mine for about 5-7 minutes on high to get to a ""flooding"" consistency and about 8-10 minutes for ""outlining"" consistency for decorating cookies.  Just keep beating...it will thicken up.  This is a meringue icing...JUST BEAT IT!!  ;)"
1,"Recipe is quite misleading - I ended up using over a pound of confectioner&apos;s sugar to make it stiff enough to pipe onto gingerbread people to adhere decors on.  Maybe if I were to ever use this recipe again, I&apos;d use just one egg white and take it from there.  I had a LOT of waste after adding all that sugar to stiffen it up."
5,"I was just shy of 4 cups of icing sugar, but I had already cracked the 4 eggs needed to make a whole batch.  I didn&apos;t want to waste them, so I added them all anyways.  At first the icing was really runny, but it started to harden fairly quickly after I applied it to my gingerbread cookies (Eileen&apos;s Spicy Gingerbread cookies from this site).  Even using your standard ziplock sandwich bag to apply the icing it went on smoothly.  I was quite impressed with this recipe overall!
                                I used rum extract (artificial) instead of lemon, but I think next time I may try the lemon or maybe almond or vanilla.  Two thumbs up!"
5,"We thought these were great. It&apos;s not the only chocolate chip cookie recipe I&apos;ll use, but when you want a ""big, fat, chewy cookie,"" this is awesome. For the cookies to stay chewy, they need to be left on the cookie sheet until cool. (Except, of course, for the few you just can&apos;t resist eating right out of the oven.) Also, the butter MUST be melted, and the flour should be all-purpose UNsifted. 10/17/04: I notice that some people have mentioned that this is a cakey cookie. I did not find that at all, and I HATE cakey cookies. My suggestions to avoid cakiness are: use real butter, be sure to melt the butter, don&apos;t overbeat your eggs, and do NOT skip the extra egg yolk."
5,"HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: This is very forgiving! Just keep baking until it becomes golden brown around the edges. If they cool COMPLETELY & they&apos;re not done..put back in for another 5 min.  Can&apos;t go wrong! I promise they&apos;ll be super chewy although they must sit (set) for awhile as they won&apos;t appear it.  I&apos;ve had to bake for 20 min. several times! Everything is dependent on if you put in fridge & for how long (i&apos;ve left overnight or for DAYS). But if you don&apos;t refrigerate long enough or at all, they&apos;ll be flat! It has nothing to do with using margarine or butter. I&apos;ve done it both ways ..same exact results! 1st: Sift the dry ingredients.  Melt the butter in microwave then mix in sugars. DO use the room temp. yoke of one egg & 1 other egg.  Dump rest of ingredients on top.  Mix by hand until blended.  Make sure butter isn&apos;t hot or it&apos;ll melt chocolate chips! Refrigerate batter for 1hr then preheat oven.  Drop 1/4C scoop (should make 16-18) & bake! If I use a med. scoop, I just bake 2 min less.  UPDATE: My husband thinks these are sweet so I only use 3/4C b.s. and a TAD under 1/2C of white sugar. 1C chocolate chips is PLENTY! Never grease pan! Melt in your mouth results if you use a combination of milk chocolate& semi-sweet like bakeries AND a touch of andes mint baking chips! Update2: Just tried ""Blonde Brownies I"" and it&apos;s IDENTICAL, but a yummy brownie! Try it!"
5,"I have tried quite a few chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this is by far the BEST!  Don&apos;t be alarmed by the reviewers who say theirs turned out flat.  Because the butter is melted, you MUST refrigerate these before baking (long enough so they get hard, an hour or two, or speed up by putting in freezer).  Also, you will want to wait a bit to eat as they are a bit gooey at first. Take the cookies out of the oven when the edges are just turning brown, leave on cookie sheet for a few min, and then let rest a bit longer to ensure best results.  If you want these cookies to stay moist, put in sealed container after baking.  If you want them crunchy, leave them exposed to air.  Whatever you do - don&apos;t pass these up.  My friends wonder what amazing bakery I buy these at whenever I make them."
5,"Update: Learn from my mistake...Use MARGARINE rather than butter in this recipe if you want a thick cookie.
                                Wow! This cookie is absolutely heavenly! I&apos;ve tried many of the other high rated chocolate chip cookies from this site, and this is by FAR the best one yet!  I won&apos;t look any where else for a chocolate chip cookie recipe.  The cookie comes out soft and think with literally layers of chocolate chips inside!  Like many other reviewers, I did not grease my pan and the cookies came off just fine once they were cool. Also, make sure your eggs are close to room temp rather than straight from the fridge. Fifteen minutes was the perfect time to bake these.  The edges are lightly browned, and the middle of the cookie may look slightly undone, but trust me, they are done perfectly at this time!  Lastly, definitely chill the dough for a while.  Forty-five minutes did the trick for my batch!  Thank you Elizabeth! Wonderful cookies!:-) Ally"

5,"W-O-W!!!! I&apos;m speechless. Just when I was beginning to give up my faith in this website. I mean, come on...half the time the reviews are great and you make the dish and you&apos;re SOOOO disappointed. 
                                
                                NOT WITH THIS RECIPE! These cookies are the hot-diggidy-dog of all chocolate chip cookies. They&apos;re better than bakery or coffee shop cookies (and better than refrigerated cookie dough too). We definitely need to double the recipe next time! 
                                
                                I think what makes it stand out from other recipes is the extra egg yolk (without the white) and more brown sugar than white sigar. I think those two ingredients help with the cookies chewiness texture and make it not so cakey. 
                                
                                FYI: Take them out of the oven after 13 minutes....otherwise they&apos;ll be too done, even though they may not look it. AND I recommend following another reviewers suggestion and DO NOT grease the cookie sheet, it makes them wierd around the edges. THANKS ELIZABETH!"
5,"This was the worst cookie recipe ever...They were so damn good i ate waaaayyy too many and got sick for 2 days...no joke. :) Great job. Anytime I make chocolate chip cookies again it will be these. They are a bit tricky in baking. A hint is to take them out before they ""feel or look"" done. Because once they cool they will be perfect."
5,"After sitting hours upon hours in front of a computer searching for that one chocolate chip cookie recipe that would be &apos;the one&apos;, I finally found it. This cookie is pefect in my opinion. They are huge, a little crunchy when you first bite into them but soooo wonderfully chewy in the middle. Breaking the cookie into, you see the many layers of chocolate chips. This makes a thick cookie, not a flat cookie, which, is one of the reasons I loved this recipe. Thank you for submitting your recipe. I don&apos;t have to look any further now!!"
5,"These cookies are wonderful!  They look just like they came from one of the cookie shops at the mall.  I am impressed.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts because I like nutty cookies.  If you let the eggs warm to room temperature, I think it helps to keep the cookies from flattening out too much.  Also, with these, the consistency is the best if you remove them from the oven when only the edges look baked and the top is still a bit soft."
1,these cookies were dry when cooked all the way through and too big.
3,"This has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup.  As is, it’s just o.k.   To me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce.  It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me."
3,"Three stars because it actually tasted good, but the whole cooking process was just strange. In all my years of cooking, I have never seen instructions like that. All you really gotta do is brown your butter, add the other veggies along with the broth, simmer til the vegetables are done. Then add your thickener - in this case, flour and melted butter. Then you add the milk and the cheese. It turned out great this way, and only took me and my daughter about a half hour to make it. Simmering the already thickened broth/milk for 20 minutes? Then adding the vegetables and cooking them for another 20 minutes? Seems to me that the recipe instructions are actually written in reverse!"
5,"I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn&apos;t have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle&apos;s sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera&apos;s.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!"
2,"I hate to leave a 2-star, unfavorable review.  However, to be fair to those who want to try this in the future, I want to give my opinion: it was bland and utterly tasteless. I was so disappointed that I didn&apos;t care how close it was to Panera&apos;s recipe -- I just wanted flavor!  I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too), and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner, and I will make this regularly throughout the winter, WITH my additions. Good luck!"
5,"The family loved this soup. The only changes I made was to thin the roux with chicken broth instead of milk and added the broth instead of milk. Then I added all the veggies and simmered it, then added the milk at the end. Wonderful soup!"
5,"I&apos;ve made this soup before using a different recipe, couldn&apos;t find the old recipe so I decided to give this a try. I used the exact measurements and ingredients listed except celery, the only other difference I made was instead of simmering the milk/flour/butter to thicken I used chicken broth as the liquid, let it simmer a little (around 7 minutes) added all my veggies and 1/2 cup of water (my burners are too strong and I feared all the liquid evaporating and becoming a pudding instead of a soup) and let it simmer until veggies were tender. Last step I added milk, cheese and served. WOW. BIG HIT with me and my husband who doesn&apos;t like soup. The flavor was all there, just be careful with adding salt as most chicken stocks already have sodium and cheese adds a lot."
4,As the submitter said it&apos;s open to what you like to make your changes to fit your taste. I found two copycat Panera bread broccoli-cheese soup recipes - here & food.com. They are very very very similar. Food.com adds nutmeg. I like the almost invisible taste of nutmeg in creamy soups. I am not a nutmeg fan (always halve it in baked goods) but in this soup: Mmmm! I changed the directions because they seemed really odd/off the order of things. This one says 1 1/2c broccoli; the other 1/2#. &apos;Pretty sure the answer is in between those two. I went with close to 1/2#. Daughter said it had too much broccoli or not enough cheese - didn&apos;t know which.:) Anywayyyy I microsteamed it three minutes then allowed to cool. I sauteed 2 medium sized cut-bigger-than-matchstick carrots in 1/4c butter 5 minutes; then added 1 pc celery diced sauteed 2 minutes; then about half cup onion (half onion) five minutes. &apos;Meant to do the sprinkling of 1/4c flour next but got ancy & added 2c homemade chicken broth next. Put that in a blender (daughter request) along with the broccoli then back in the pot & thickened once it got hot. After thickening added 1/4t salt & nutmeg; & 1/8t black pepper; 1c 2% milk; 1c half&half.(Probably go for all half&half next time or more thickener with milk). I chopped up an 8oz block Kraft sharp cheddar but it wasn&apos;t sharp enough enough cheese or both. Simmered 15 minutes. Good soup.:)
3,"*arthur fist* Like many of the other reviewers, I had to tweak the recipe. The instructions didn’t read well to me so I took some suggestions and now I think I have a good system to get things the way I’d like.
                                
                                 I used 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar, 4 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup of thin carrots, 4 table spoons of butter, ¼ cup of flour,  2 cloves minced garlic, ½ onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1 tsp of nutmeg 10 oz of broccoli. Steam broccoli until soft and easy to cut (It took forever to get soft simmering with everything else) In another pot sautee onions, carrots (if you don’t have a blender I’d make the pieces even smaller) in butter until tender, then add flour and cook for a minute. Add 2 cups of broth to onions, carrots, and flour mixture. Add in your cup of heavy cream and bring to a boil then lower the temp, remove from heat and add cheese gradually while stirring (if you throw in all the cheese at once it&apos;ll get clumpy). Your mixture should be thick at this point, add the last 2 cups of broth to thin it out, and add in your broccoli. Add seasonings to taste. Let simmer for awhile and it should be good to go."
3,"I&apos;m rating it 3 because I have to rate it. But for a suggestion since I&apos;ve made the Panera copycat before. First is to blend the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a blender. Second, the secret ingredient is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product. And btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth."
5,"The best pizza crust recipe that I have ever made! When using jarred active dry yeast, 2-1/4 tsp. yeast = (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast."
5,"We love this recipe. It&apos;s extremely easy to double and works just as well, so we usually make a double batch and put one pizza in the freezer to eat sometime later. We find this recipe to be equal to any typical rise-then-punch-then-rise crust we&apos;ve made, and far superior to any frozen or refrigerated store-bought pizza crust.
                                
                                I usually add mixed herbs to the dough - I sometimes just do a teaspoon of ground-up ""pizza spice"" but if I don&apos;t have pizza spice on hand I&apos;ll just toss in a mixture of approx 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1/4 tsp onion powder. (The best and easiest way to add herbs is to mix them into the olive oil before you add it to the batter - that will ensure even distribution throughout the entire dough.) Then I mix a bit of garlic powder (about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp) into the olive oil that I brush onto the edge of the crust, which gives it a touch of garlicky flavor and helps the edge turn nice and golden in the oven.
                                
                                Added later: I&apos;ve also used this recipe to make breadsticks; I still add the herbs and garlic oil, and do everything according to the recipe. After letting the dough rise for 5-10 min, pinch off golfball-sized pieces and roll them between your hands until they&apos;re 4-5"" long. Cook on a lightly greased cookie sheet, 1"" apart, at 450 for 14-18 minutes. It makes 12-16 4""-5"" breadsticks."
5,"Homemade pizza crust! What a treat for my and husbanad and me. I&apos;ve never made dough from scratch before and this couldn&apos;t be easier. I found this recipe over the weekend and have already made it twice. To make it even easier, I cut out the step where I beat the ingredients together. I just use my hands. So easy and good! Both times I&apos;ve used this dough recipe with the Classic Margharita Pizza recipe on this website. What a great combination! Try to get a pizza stone if you don&apos;t have one because it bakes perfectly. Both times my husband keeps on forgetting I made it from scratch and didn&apos;t pick it up at a gourmet restaurant. Bravo!"
5,"This is as easy as can be. These days, I make it every two weeks, and not for pizza -- which I&apos;ve used it for, as well as calzones -- but for foccaccia bread.
                                
                                I&apos;ve decided to stop buying baguette, which is deadly to a single girl, and now make a double batch of this.
                                
                                I *do* knead it for 5-10 minutes. I raise it an hour or two, then I cut it into 8 balls. Each portion I stick in a Ziploc sandwich bag, then freeze.
                                
                                I pop it in the fridge the night before I want one, let it come to room temp for an hour after work, shape into a flatbread on a floured board, let it rise until a finger indent remains, preheat my pizza stone to 450, put olive oil, sea salt, rosemary on my flatbread, and bake until it&apos;s golden-brown and bubbly. WONDERFUL.
                                
                                For a pizza bianco -- a little fresh basil, fresh mozza, sea salt (add charcuterie if you like) -- and bake until happy.
                                
                                For calzone, it&apos;s fabulous.
                                
                                Freezing this dough gives it time to rise and get happy. It&apos;s easy to make, will freeze for 4-6 weeks, and I highly recommend it as a way to give yourself a LITTLE incredible flatbread with a barbecued meal, salad, whatever.
                                
                                Just my take. :)"
5,"This recipe makes homemade pizza a simple dinner any night of the week.  I usually double it to make two big pizzas.  The only thing I change is the cooking method.  I heat the oven to 450, put the dough on a big cookie sheet, pop it into the oven on the lowest rack, turn it up to 500, and let it bake for 5 minutes.  Then I pull it out, turn the heat down to 450 again, spread on sauce, cheese and toppings, and put it back into the oven until the cheese is melted.  This always gives a perfectly brown crust that is crispy on the edges and bottom.  Even with my cheap oven and no pizza stone, baking this way gives great results!"
5,"My cleaning lady, a dough expert, changed the instructions slightly and we ended up with a beautiful, soft dough.
                                Instead of using the entire cup of warm water in which to dissolve the yeast, she used only a half cup, and the remaining half she added to the flour mixture.  She also took time to knead the dough and let it rest. Results were amazing!  I had her make some mini rounds to use as appetizers and some slightly larger ones to freeze to use as part of a quick meal or snack when needed.  I&apos;ll have her make more next week!  She also mentioned that, if you added more sugar (to taste), this dough would make a lovely bread."
5,"Delicious & Easy!  I read previous reviews and also added Italian spices and onion powder.  Also, let dough rise 1/2 hour.  Great recipe.  Will make again."
4,This crust is just as it says - quick and easy. It&apos;s the first time I&apos;ve made my own pizza crust. It is at least as good as most restaurant pizza crusts. Also it was easier to work with than most crust mixes I&apos;ve used.  Others have said it doesn&apos;t have a lot of flavor but -it&apos;s pizza crust- what do you expect. I like it and my husband likes it too.
3,"This is a good if you&apos;re REALLY pressed for time, but it didn&apos;t turn out as well as my usual recipe that calls for a dough rise.  I added Italian seasoning and garlic, and the crust still tasted somewhat bland."
5,Everyone loves this it&apos;s addictive. Some hints when doing the butter/graham crust add 1/4 teasp. cinnamon. Melt butter in a pot on stove then stir in the graham crackers then put it in the pan and press it down evenly. This way the crust stays together much better than just sprinkling it.
5,I used a combination of chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and walnuts. I pre-mixed these along with the coconut and poured the mixture over the condensed milk. My daughter who absolutely HATES nuts and my son who isn&apos;t especially fond of coconut couldn&apos;t stay away from these. Nobody could! These easy things were the holiday favorites at the parties I took them to and it made me wish I hadn&apos;t wasted my time on all the other difficult desserts I also brought (and ended up bringing back home). I would not line the pan with foil--I believe it would tear when cutting and get stuck in the cookie bars. Eeww. I used a glass dish without greasing it first and it wasn&apos;t a bad clean-up at all. Do chill the bars before cutting and cut the bars into SMALL servings as a little goes a long way with this super-rich recipe. I definitely would mix the graham crackers and melted butter next time pressing them firmly into the pan and then greasing the dish might be a good idea. I might also try semi-sweet chocolate chips as this recipe is ultra-sweet.
4,I mixed the crumbs into the butter before patting it into the pan. Also I wish I had added the nuts before the coconut so the nuts wouldn&apos;t taste roasted. Other than that this was a simple recipe and it was a good combination of flavors. The sides didn&apos;t stick much to the pan but next time I&apos;ll try the foil and spray as suggested for easier cleanup.
5,My older sister made these about 20 years ago for Christmas and I have made them every year since! They are a always a big hit at the office and at holiday gatherings. I usually make a slightly thicker crust but other than that follow the recipe faithfully. And yes these are VERY rich...so cut into small bars. Tip: Mix the chips nuts and coconut together in a mixing bowl and then press into pan...more evenly distributes all the ingredients..
4,These are fabulous. However I increased the crust to 2 1/2 cups of crumbs and added a little more butter to the original recipe. I also added 1/2 cup of white choco-chips and reduced the amount of nuts. It really has to cool before being cut or it makes a mess. They freeze very well especially if left uncut.
5,I volunteered to bring something for our annual Christmas bazaar for church - even though I don&apos;t bake much any more. These were so easy to make! I used the version with 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscotch. The ladies in the kitchen that were packaging the baked goods tasted them and said they were great. It seems that a lot of people know what they are because they sold right away. If you want better directions for the same recipe look for the site that says 7 layer Magic Bars by Eagle brand - they seem to have improved the directions for that recipe.
5,"This has always been a favorite of mine since I was young. When I left the States in 1974 and settled in Australia my biggest problem was that I couldn&apos;t get graham crackers so I substituted a ""Coffee"" biscuit. This worked fine. The only other change I make is to pour the condensed milk over all the layers just before I put it in the oven. This seems to bind everything together and the top then turns a lovely golden brown when cooked. This is always a hit at any gathering."
4,My kids went crazy for these very sweet and chocolately. The crust was a little tricky for me though I don&apos;t understand why the butter needs to be melted in the oven? Next time I&apos;ll just put it in the microwave mix in the crumbs and press into the pan:)
5,I made this recipes with 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 reeses peanut butter morsels mix and it was outstanding. I also found it helpful to press down on the bars with a spatula before baking this makes it settle better. For a quick clean up line the pan with aluminum foil and spray the foil with PAM.
3,I just think these cookies have way too many chocolate chips. If you reduce the chocolate chips to 1 and 1/4 cups it is much better and then worthy of five stars but not as is.
4,"Great dip for football season! I used Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce, 1/3 less-fat cream cheese (aka Neufchatel), and 1 lb. of fresh chicken that was boiled for 20 minutes (or until done) and then shredded. However, to avoid the strange ""orange sherbert"" color of the dip, I layered the ingredients in a 8""x11"" baking dish as follows:  Mix together the softened cream cheese and ranch dressing and spread evenly in the bottom of the dish.  Then mix together the shredded chicken and wing sauce (about 2/3 bottle)and layer on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Sprinkle just a small amount of shredded cheese (I used Colby/Jack) over the top.  Bake at 350 for about 20-25 minutes or until dip is heated through and cheese is melted.  I just think people tend to shy away from the dip when it&apos;s all mixed together because of the strange color.  It&apos;s more recognizable (retains a brighter red color) when it&apos;s layered and gets gobbled up faster!"
5,"I have made a variation of this recipe for over a year now and have never been disappointed.  I suggest using more chicken and more hot sauce with this recipe. Also, if you use the chedder cheese, don&apos;t use the pre-shredded bags from the grocery store.  The cheese in those bags is coated with flour and it seems to make the dip oiler."
5,"the biggest hit for the superbowl party!  I did use bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch because thats what you eat with buffalo chicken!  I also used 2 boneless chicken breasts instead of canned chicken (i cant stand canned meats) grilled it in a pan, cut it into bite sized pieces, put it back in the pan with the hot sauce. When I mixed the the cream cheese and bleu cheese together I added more hotsauce for more of a kick.  Baked in an 8x8 pan, 350 for 20 minutes.  Dip was gone in minutes!   will make 100 more times!!"
5,"A KEEPER! A really tasty and unique dip with the perfect amount of zip. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, boiled and shredded. (I can&apos;t stand canned meat) I mixed all ingredients and baked it in a uncovered casserole dish for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Then I converted it to a crock pot to keep it warm. I served it with tostito scoops and celery. It was the talk of the party!!"
5,"I got this recipe about a month ago off of this site to take to a pitch-in and since then have made it 3 more times!  It&apos;s a total hit and everyone loves it!  My changes (okay, I made quite a few): use 1/2 cup Frank&apos;s Buffalo Wing Sauce and 1/2 cup Red Hot, 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing and 1/2 cup Blue Cheese dressing, and put almost all of the cheese in the dip and just sprinkle some on top.  Oh yeah, and we used fresh chicken shredded in the food processor as someone suggested.  And we didn&apos;t like the crock pot method - it made the dip get dried out pretty quickly.  We just cooked it on the stove and put it into a serving dish (we did end up puting in the microwave a few times, but that was okay).  This is great because the recipe itself is very low carbs and you can use low fat cream cheese, dressing, and cheese and you don&apos;t experience all that much guilt... especially when served with celery sticks (although those Fritos scoops are fabulous!)  Thanks for this one!"
5,"This is a great and easy appetizer to make and is very well received and I have never brought any home from any party.  I read the reviews before making it and like many others I made a few modifications that I think helped make the recipe better.  I used 1 lb of skinless chicken breasts which I cleaned, sliced into strips and par boiled for 15 minutes, drained, and cooled for a few minutes.  When the chicken is cool it will be very easy to shred with your fingers.  I used a large skillet where I placed 1 Cup of Frank’s Red hot which is what is used in Buffalo, NY at the Anchor Bar to make real Buffalo chicken wings.  I also added a ½ stick of butter which is also a very common ingredient in the preparation of Buffalo chicken wings.  While the chicken and Frank’s is warming slowly, I mixed one cup of Blue cheese dressing and the cream cheese until smooth and placed it into the refrigerator until I was ready to make the dip. After the chicken and Frank’s were good and warm I placed this into a plastic container for later use as well.  This gets everything ready for the next day or for later in the day to just place it together and warm in the oven.  When I was ready for the dip I pre-heated the oven to 350 placed the blue cheese mixture into the bottom of a 7x11” baking pan and layered the chicken onto the top of the blue cheese.  I topped the whole thing with a small amount of shredded mozzarella / provolone cheese and po"
5,"This is sooo good!!!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in the oven for 20 min instead of the slow-cooker. Next time I&apos;ll try it with blue cheese dressing instead od ranch. Either way, you can&apos;t go wrong!"
5,I made this today for the first time and it is excellent!! I have been trying out lots of different recipes to prepare for my annual Halloween party and this one will definately make it to the table! Canned chicken is repulsive to me so I used rotissary chicken (from Sams) which has such wonderful flavor and compliments the entire dish. Also...nothing beats Franks Original Hot Sauce! Used blue cheese instead of ranch and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Combined all in the crock pot and let it sit on low for a couple of hours. Served with tortilla chips celery and scoops. Yum yum yum!!!
5,"This is excellent. I&apos;ve made this dish many times and everyone keeps requesting it again. I mix 1/2 Ranch dressing and 1/2 blue cheese. I do not use the chedder cheese. I tried it once and did not care for the oily orange greasy appearance. A few other ""improvements"" I&apos;ve made are I melt 1/2 a stick of butter before warming the meat in the frying pan. Also I recently began substituting ground turky and found it much eaiser than cooking and shredding chicken. It has a nicer texture in the dip and tastes the same."
3,Definitely wasn&apos;t what I expected....  probably won&apos;t make again.
3,"Many other reviewers have noted that - as written - the lasagna needs to be watched carefully for appropriate cook time. That pretty much negates the benefit of a crockpot approach for me (I prefer to just start the food, then not worry about it.) What the recipe is really missing is WATER. Before assembling, mix your tomato sauce with equal parts water. Use that as your tomato mixture. With the extra water, the recipe won&apos;t turn out as dry. It will take longer to cook - about 6-8 hours on low. The benefit there is you can pretty much go to work, run errands, etc. while your food cooks. Now it makes sense as a crockpot recipe again."
5,"We really enjoyed this!! I did some playing around with it as others have. Replaced the cottage cheese with Ricotta and I used more tomato sauce and paste to make more of the sauce as I have one of the old crockpots that&apos;s just huge. I also put in some Italian seasoning and some roasted garlic. Just make sure that all your noodles are covered with the sauce and it will come out just great. The time was a little different for me too. It only took about 4 1/2 to 5 hours in my pot, but you have to remember that all crockpots are not the same, the size and shape can change the timing a great deal.  I&apos;ve made this twice now and it has come out wonderful both times. I serve it with Mama D&apos;s Italian bread (from this site) and a salad and what a meal!!  Thanks Kim for a great way to make homemade lasagna without all the fuss!"
5,"This turned out very well! Delicious and filling. Of course, I had to read the reviews before attempting this. First, yes, do away with the salt entirely. The pasta sauce will have enough of it. Second, to make the cheese mixture easier to spread (I substituted fat-free ricotta for cottage cheese), add a slightly beaten egg. Finally, make sure that you are using oven-ready/no-boil lasagna noodles (don&apos;t cook them beforehand) instead of the regular kind. They will absorb the liquids and therefore cook on their own. It really does depend on your pot, but my lasagna cooked in just under four hours. The sides were slightly burned (but I like it that way... and I&apos;m thankful I sprayed the pot with Pam before adding the ingredients). Next time I think I might add some drained canned mushrooms to the sauce to make sure that I get my serving of vegetables, since I will definitely make this again (no more Stouffer&apos;s for me)."
4,"If all items are preassembled and put in the &apos;fridge the night before, it needs to only be in the slow cooker for half the recommended time."
5,"This is such a hit!  I have made it several times before and people always ask for the recipe.  Today was the first time I brought it to work and everyone raved about it.  Normally, I follow the recipe, but this time I added a big jar of Ragu to the hamburger, onion, and garlic.  I add extra mozzarella on top in the last hour so it is cheesier on top.  I also cooked it for 1 hour on low and 2 1/2 hours on high and it was wonderful.  The noodles were just right.  I will continue to make this often.  Thank you."
5,"We did a lot of changes but loved it.  We used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage, used fresh basil in the sauce mixture, added jar sauce over the top of the filled crock pot and topped off with some of the saved mozzeralla cheese the last 30 minutes.  This is easy and a keeper."
5,"Delicious and perfect. I feel it&apos;s a good idea to read every review if possible, at least skim them, because everyone&apos;s crockpot and experience is different and you can avoid costly mistakes. I did that and was able to make the adjustments that made this dish turn out wonderful. This was the first dish I made in my new 6-quart slow cooker (call me lasagna lover). I used 3 cups jarred spaghetti sauce, 1 cup water, and half a can diced tomatoes in juice because I had it left over from another day. I added an egg to the ricotta and used minced dried onion instead of a fresh one, and garlic powder. Also added some Italian spices, not too much, and no salt. I used 12 oz. whole wheat lasagna, the regular kind, not precooked. I cooked the whole dish on low for EXACTLY 4 hours, and it turned out heavenly. I think a lot of the problem of dry, chewy noodles comes from overcooking...do not be tempted to keep on cooking. Cover the noodles in sauce and mozzarella, and you will be fine. I didn&apos;t use the high setting at all. Will repeat often."
4,I substituted 2-jars of spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes onions and garlic. Added minced garlic (from the jar) oregano italian seasoning and salt to taste. Also I added italian sausage to the hamburger. It came out delicious but a bit overcooked at 8-hours in the crock pot. Next time I will adjust to 6-hours.
1,I hated this lasagne. It was VERY salty and I saw no benefit to cooking it in the slow cooker. No time was saved. It&apos;s faster to cook lasagne in the oven and the taste was lacking. I&apos;ll stick with my tried and true lasagne recipe from Bon Appetit!
5,"My words from 2008 still hold true today.  My little grandmother (and I do mean little - not more than 4&apos; 11"") would wonder what all the fuss is about - this is her recipe.  Thanks to all who have commented on this little guardian angel&apos;s recipe developed years ago in her kitchen as a treat for my dad who took care of her yard and garden after my grandfather died.  I am still in awe of the number of you that have tried my Grandma Ople&apos;s recipe for apple pie and love it so much.  Now that she has been gone almost 15 years there seems to be less and less of her to hold on to and to pass along to her great granchildren (and great-great grandchildren) who will never know her.    Some might say that having originated a delicious apple pie recipe is not much of a legacy, but when I read the reviews and notes of those who have tried her recipe, and the settings and family gatherings at which they have shared her pie, I can truly say that God has worked through my Grandmother to help bring families joy and love.  Thank you all for your comments about my Grandmother&apos;s favorite recipe.  Rebecca Clyma Proud Grand-daughter of Grandma Ople"
5,"A++ Decadently Delicious!  Ive tried many recipes from this site, all of them pleasing.  But this is the first time I&apos;ve ever been so inspired by one to write a review!  You wont find a better recipe for apple pie.  
                                
                                I read every review for people&apos;s advice before starting, and did make a few adjustments to the original.  Some mentioned granny smith apples were too tart.  Stick with the recipe on that one.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, a good dash of nutmeg and a tablespoon of vanilla to the syrup prior to simmering (compensate for adding the vanilla by omiting a tablespoon of that 1/4 cup of water).  Next, definately mix the syrup with the apples rather than trying to pour into the pie (save enough to glaze top crust).  Do use a 9"" glass pie pan to avoid spillage.  Use the middle shelf in the oven (so top crust doesnt brown too fast).  And last but not least, I did the lattice top crust, and it turned out picture perfect, but im convinced that using a complete top crust with designer slits cut into it would turn out just as beautifully.  Whatever you decide to do with the top crust, just remember the syrup you saved to glaze the top with needs to still be HOT or it will thicken up on you, so have your plan together and move quickly.    
                                
                                In all, this recipe is amazing.  I will make this for anyone I am trying to impress!  Three cheers for Grandma Opal and family."
5,"I&apos;ve made this pie three times now, and it&apos;s always made a delicious pie.  However, I had an epiphany before making it this last time that greatly improved the result.  I&apos;ve been adding a tbs of cinnamon as was recommended by other reviewers, but made the mistake of adding the cinnamon to the sauce.  The pie tasted fine, but the presentation didn&apos;t seem as impressive as people raved about.  It was dark brown and unappealing.  This last time, it occured to me that the cinnamon was making the pie turn dark, so instead of mixing the cinnamon into the sauce, I mixed it into the apples in a bowl before pouring the apples into the crust.  The sauce I prepared as stated in the recipe.  The resulting pie was picture perfect in its presentation, and cinnamon taste was just as good.  So remember, if you want to add cinnamon, add it to the apples, not the sauce."
5,"Believe the hype.
                                I made this for the first time for a dinner party I had last week - mostly because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. And it did not disappoint. Women were begging for the recipe. Men were saying it was the best apple pie they had ever tasted. There were riots over who was going to get the last piece.
                                
                                I followed everyone&apos;s suggestions here... prepared the lattice ahead of time and kept it in the fridge til ready... mixed a tsp of cinnamon to the butter and sugar mixture... brushed egg whites on bottom crust to keep from getting soggy... poured 2/3 of mixture over the apples first, then the rest over the top of the crust... baked at 350F for the whole time to avoid burnt topping... put baking tray in bottom of the over to catch the drips.  
                                
                                Hence forth I am eschewing all other apple pie recipes. Truly spectacular."
5,"OK, you&apos;ve probably read many reviews as to  how delicious this pie is (and it really is!).  What you&apos;ve also read is the submitter forgot to list the cinnamon in the recipe or how you should forgo the lattice crust and a few other suggestions.  
                                
                                Let me strongly suggest that you try this recipe unaltered at least once.  The  point is that this is a small twist on traditional apple pie, so no cinnamon (or nutmeg or cloves or raisins etc.).  The lattice crust is essential because it lets you pour the caramel mixture over the top and it drains into the fresh apples underneath while leaving a thin coat on the lattice crust.  It really isn&apos;t hard to do...there&apos;s even a short video of a teenager making a lattice crust pie for a dinner in honor of his mom&apos;s visiting friend.  Check it out if you need some pointers.
                                
                                I also saw comments suggesting to use 6 apples instead of 8.  Another suggestion I saw several times said to just put the pie in at 350 degrees for 1 hour and it&apos;s fine.  I would say if you are using an 8"" pie dish, sure, reduce it down to 6 apples but for a 9"" dish, 8 apples was just right (I could have probably squeezed in one more).  I would also strongly suggest following the baking instructions because the higher temperature helps set the bottom of the crust.  With fresh fruit pies, there  is a chance the crust will not fully bake in the center as the fruit releases liquid.  The high temperatures ""temper"" the crust during the first 15 minutes of baking.  
                                
                                Finally,"
5,"WONDERFUL PIE!!! I heeded other&apos;s warnings and suggestions on this one. 1. I baked the pie at 350 degreees for the entire time to minimize scorching.
                                2. I added 2 tablespoons flour and 1 tablespoon cornstarch to the syrup mixture. I also eliminated the water from the syrup mixture which made the pie very thick and gel-like. I also added cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg to the syrup.
                                3. I mixed half of the syrup with the apples themselves before putting in the pie crust.
                                4. The syrup crystalizes very easily, so I made half of the syrup to mix in with the apples. Then I was able to take my time making my lattice crust and garnishes. Then, I mixed up the rest of the syrup and brushed it on the top of the pie.
                                5. About 10 minutes before the pie was done (about 50 minutes had elapsed), I brushed the pie with a little milk and sprinkled the top with sugar and cinnamon.
                                6. After making it again, I served it warm. NOT A GOOD IDEA! It was very runny. The first time  allowed it to sit overnight and warmed it slightly in the microwave before serving.
                                I AM SO HAPPY I FOUND THIS RECIPE. I even entered it in a local pie-making contest and out of 108 entries, I recieved the grand prize and $1,000! So this is truly my award-winning pie!!! Thanks so much for the recipe! It&apos;s a keeper!"
5,"Delicious!  It came out perfect, though I did not lattice the crust.  I just put some decorative cuts into it...obviously won&apos;t change the taste,  just the look.  (I used ""Earthquake Pie Crust"" from this site) And after reading *many* of the reviews, I think the slight changes I made to the recipe made it easy to make, I knew what to expect, and not only did it not bubble over at all, it didn&apos;t even get my pan and foil dirty that I had underneath it.  This is what I did: used 4 big Red Delicious apples, and they piled up in a good mound.  Granny Smith would have made it too tart for me.  I don&apos;t know how anyone used all 8 unless they were the size of plums. ...used a glass pie dish; they are bigger and deeper than the tin ones.  ...put a pan lined with foil underneath it before baking so if any juice did run off, it wouldn&apos;t get anything dirty. ...added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbs vanilla (and also took 1 tbs of water out of the 1/4 cup). ...lastly, I added 3/4 of the caramel to the apples prior to putting them into the pie crust. The caramel will seem thick, like it doesn&apos;t run down the apples well.  But sugar helps fruit create its own juices...it will make more juice while it is baking.  Just mix it all well.  My caramel was not runny & did not bubble over during baking.  The little changes I made after reading the reviews helped to avoid mistakes others made. Thanks!"
1,"I am very disappointed by the outcome. I followed the directions exactly, except mixed the sauce with the apples. The inside was so runny, and never thickened up. I trusted the rating, but don&apos;t let it fool you. I put a lot of time and effort into this apple pie, and I can&apos;t believe it came out like this, when everyone was raving about how good it is. Does anyone have any comments about what I may have did wrong, because I read over the directions again, and I did everything right. I guess I&apos;ll keep looking for that perfect recipe. Very disappointed!"
5,"This past weekend 9/6 - 9/8/02 I made this pie for the Hillsboro County Fair in New Hampshire and won the First Prize Blue Ribbon.  I hadn&apos;t even tasted the pie, but felt confident enough to make it after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  I did add 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of cinnamon, because around here, cinnamon is a must for apple pie, and vanilla adds a wonderful flavor to just about everything.  I didn&apos;t make the latice crust...I added all of the syrup to the apples and mixed them well before placing onto the bottom crust, but I did leave a little extra to brush on the top crust.  You must try this recipe...it is delicious!!!!!!!  Thanks for helping me win the Blue Ribbon!!!!!!!!!"
5,"I substituted all butter instead of shortening to avoid the trans fats, and these cookies came out INCREDIBLE!  Gingersnaps have always been one of my special favorites--cookies I absolutely adore but tend to be picky about and thus have only very rarely.  Now I&apos;ve found a perfect recipe so I can make them on my own!  The holidays are long past, yet my apartment currently smells like Christmas, and I have about 3 dozen light, crisp, pleasantly spicy, semi-sweet cookies cooling in my kitchen.  This is definitely a recipe going in my ""Will Bake Many Times Again"" file!"
5,"I was very nervous making these cookies because Gingersnaps are my husband&apos;s favorite cookie and his mother makes them all the time all year round. I had a lot against me - biased views and no knowledge whatsoever with this type of cookie! I&apos;ve never made Gingersnaps before. The smell of the cookies during the mixing stage was wonderful! Very Christmasy. :) The baking smell was even better! My kids couldn&apos;t keep their hands off these cookies once they were done, and when I tasted them I could see why! These cookies are amazing in flavor! I did do one thing different from the recipe - I added 1 teaspoon of cloves into this as well, because my husband likes his gingersnaps good with spice. The drumroll for me came when he came home at night and I gave him a cookie to try. I could tell he wasn&apos;t expecting much (being biased for his mother&apos;s) but after the first bite his eyes got wide and he said ""Wow! These are REALLY good! They taste just like Mom&apos;s!"" I told him that her recipe is different (hers calls for oil) and he said, ""Don&apos;t worry about it - just make these - they are wonderful!"" They have a great outside texture for crunch and inside chewiness. Perfection in my husband&apos;s opinion! Now I wish I had made these much sooner in my married life. His smile and face was all worth the jitters of messing it up! :)"
4,Good gingersnap recipe. For those that don&apos;t have a sifter try using a pasta strainer or wisk prior to adding to the recipe; they work in a pinch!!! Not the best I&apos;ve had but definitely better than most! Would definitely make again!!!
5,"I made these to give away at for Christmas, and got rave reviews from everyone!  They are definitely more chewy than traditional gingersnaps, but we like them that way.  The only problem I had was trying to figure out the correct cinnamon/sugar mix.  I first used too much cinnamon and they turned out dark-looking and too ""cinnamony"". I then mixed 1/3 cup sugar with just one and half tsp. cinnamon, and they were perfect!  Very good!"
5,"This is the best ginger cookie I have ever had! I made a couple batches at Christmas. When the recipe is followed exactly, sifting and all, the cookies come out beatiful with a crackled top. But I got lazy and only sifted the second batch once. The tops didn&apos;t crackle, but the cookie was still delicious. I will be making these every year."
5,"This is the same recipe my great-grandma, grandma, and mom have used.  I lost my copy and am so glad to have found it.  I follow this recipe exactly but flatten just slightly....I like mine slightly puffy.  For my dad, I press with a glass dipped in sugar.  He likes his Gingersnaps thin and crispy.  Thanks Marie!"
4,This were good cookies - but I&apos;m only giving them 4 stars because there wasn&apos;t much &apos;snap&apos; in these gingersnaps. As a ginger cookie though these were very nice. I did add 1/4 cup more flour to my mixture so they would look puffy - instead of flattening out like my cookies always tend to do! I think the next time I make these I may add a pinch of cloves to give them a spicier flavor.
5,I LOVE these cookies and I&apos;m making them again for my family&apos;s Thanksgiving get-together. If you like your gingersnaps crispy leave them in a few extra minutes.
5,my family never made gingersnaps so when my husband requested them this year i wasn&apos;t sure about it but i love these cookies! i was scared of how strong the batter smelled because of all of the molasses but cookies have a milder taste which i love. i used butter in place of shortening and added a dash of nutmeg. thanks for a great christmas recipe!
1,I did not like this recipe at all. The cookies were bland and had way too much baking soda and ginger. All I could taste was baking soda and ginger. I am definitely in the minority here. Won&apos;t make these again!
5,Fail-proof. I followed the directions and everything turned out perfectly. ADVICE: freeze (or put in fridge) unwrapped PB cups - it is easier to press  the frozen candy into the hot cookie without falling to pieces. SUPERB!
5,"WOW! Fantastic Recipe!
                                
                                Made a single batch to try it out exactly as it was printed.  
                                
                                Some Key Tricks I Used:
                                **Make dough, and pop into refrigerator for about an hour--it makes cookies easier to scoop.
                                **I used the smallest cookie scoop I had (approx 2 tsp) and levelled off the bottom (so I had exact size balls (With flattened ends!)
                                **I scooped the first batch into the mini muffin tin...and while that batch baked, I scooped the rest of the dough onto a plate--that way I could quickly refill the pan once cooled (I have asked Santa for an extra pan for Christmas--It would be good to make more than 12 at a time!!!)
                                **Freeze PB Cups, unwrap, then pop back into freezer--until cookies are out of oven.
                                **Allow middles to ""sink"" a bit before adding the pb cup(should happen when removed from the oven after 8 minutes)  the ""sink"" will prevent the sides of the cookie from cracking.
                                **ABSOLUTELY refrigerate the pan before removing cookies for cooling rack... BUT
                                **Decorate with sprinkles BEFORE refrigerating pan--place decor quickly, as the chocolate will start to melt.  Shifting placement of the decorations will be tricky!
                                **Once cooled...HIDE from husband, kids, neighbours...they disappear faster than you can make &apos;em!
                                
                                Great recipe!"
3,"I&apos;m not sure where I went wrong, but it most have been me because all of the other reviews don&apos;t mention the cookies cracking. I used a regular muffin tin, ungreased. The balls stayed as balls, no spreading. When I took them out at 8 mins. and pressed the frozen p-nutbutter cup in, the cookies edges cracked and seperated. Any suggestions?"
4,"These were pretty good.  One thing I can say is that they dont look like they&apos;re done cooking after 8 minutes, but they are.  Dont make the mistake of overbaking them."
5,"5 Stars!  
                                I used my husband&apos;s sugary ""Skippy"" Peanut Butter.  Also used a cookie sheet insted of a muffin pan, and cookies turned out perfect.
                                
                                EASY TO MAKE. 
                                
                                DELICIOUS.  Everyone raved about them, even people who normally didn&apos;t like peanut butter.
                                
                                INGREDIENTS AND TIMING ARE PERFECT.  I wouldn&apos;t suggest changing a thing.  I thought that they were not done at first, and was tempted to leave them in longer, but the cook time was perfect.
                                
                                LONGEVITY/FRESHNESS.  The cookies stayed fresh and soft for quite awhile in the cookie tins they were in.  
                                
                                OVERALL, an excellent recipe that I will be making and sharing every Christmas, for years to come!"
5,"I made these for my Christmas Party and they were a hit!  I doubled the recipe and came out with 72 cookies.  I would recommend popping the trays into the refrigerator after you place the candy cups in the cookies.  If you don&apos;t, the chocolate centers keep melting and it takes longer for them to cool and store.  Easy to remove from the tray and small enough to fit many on a serving tray.  I will definitely make these again."
5,"These are great!  My husband has pretty much polished them off in 2 days by himself, I will have to make a couple more batches for the christmas tins.  One hint, I didn&apos;t know how big to make the balls of dough, to get 40 cookies, make them about 3/4 inch in diameter."
5,I used whole wheat white flour (it&apos;s lighter in texture and naturally sweeter than regular whole wheat) and all natural PB. Husband couldn&apos;t tell these cookies were 100% whole grain and gobbled them right up. I chilled the dough for a few hours and instead of forming balls I just used a medium cookie scoop to get uniform-sized rounded mounds in the fraction of the time. I dropped the mounds into regular muffin tins because that&apos;s all I had but they still came out looking great. I did have to cook them 3 min longer though because I made them larger than what the recipe called for. Don&apos;t make the mistake of cooking them too long (recipe is right on unless you make your cookies bigger). The dough should be soft when you take it out. The first time I made this I baked them too long (waited for them to turn golden) and they were dry.
5,"These cookies were EXCELLENT! i test most of my recipies on my sister and my boyfriend and they both LOVED THEM! They both keep begging me to make more. i followed the recipe exactly, however instead of putting the batter into muffin cups i simply rounded the dough and put them on the cookie sheet and pressed the reeses cups into them immediatly after taking them out of the oven! worked extremely well! LOVE IT:)"
4,I grew up on this casserole. I have made it dozens and dozens of time for my own family. Modifications .... for sure.....I added a thinly sliced onion when browning the mushrooms.  I make a roux with butter and flour (I like my flour to have that nice nutty flavour that it gets when you make a roux) that step really amps up the dish. Also deglaze your fry pan with 1/2 cup  of white wine and then pop the entire meal into the oven and cook on 325 for an hour. Fall off the bone tasty.
5,"Delicious as written! My chops were thick so I did have to cook them longer but this is an excellent recipe. With the exception of bacon, pork is my least favorite meat so for me to give 5 stars for pork says a lot."
5,"This recipe is very good. I added fresh Italian parsley for color and a bit of mild flavor. It is pretty easy and tasty. Just boil some potatoes and serve with the sauce. This is a truly delicious dinner. I think dried or fresh thyme could be used and will be just as awesome as it it. Will make it again. Have some crusty bread to eat the remnants of sauce. Update: If you want to add some richness and body to the sauce, before adding the garlic and mushrooms, try this:  add about 2tsps of white wine, deglaze the pan, and let the wine dissipate before adding the garlic and mushrooms. Yum!"
5,"Made it twice. First as directed above. The second time I used portobello mushrooms and added red onions and halved the broth amount and added white wine for the other half,  and it was amazing!!!!"
5,"KEEPER!  We can&apos;t wait to have this again!  Just follow the recipe and you&apos;ll be happy!  I did add about another 1 1/2 teaspoons of flour to the mix, but that&apos;s all I did.  This is really good!  Thanks, April!"
5,"This turned out very nicely. The only change I made was with the mustard. I didn&apos;t have dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard. The pork chops were very tender, and the sauce/gravy was delicious. The only thing I might add is onions with the mushrooms and garlic."
5,I’m new to cooking and made a couple mistakes but oh man this was an amazing recipe!
5,"Thank you for sharing this recipe! I am always on the lookout for quick and simple recipes and this one definitely fit the bill. I made mine with 4 thin, boneless pork chops and I only added 2 cloves of garlic. I also added a small chopped Vidalia onion and man was it delicious!! My husband spooned the extra gravy over 2 grands biscuits because he liked it so much. 
                                I will most definitely make this again and plan to share it with my daughter and daughter in law."
3,"Don&apos;t know, exactly, what I expected from this recipe, but I was a bit disappointed in it.
                                
                                Tasted ""ok"", at best, with me adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder- repeatedly.
                                
                                My husband liked it.......
                                
                                Guess I was expecting more with the recipe note that it was close to one served to the author, at a restaurant. 
                                
                                Probability of making it again, are slim."
5,"This is sooo good! I, too, only added 1/2 c sugar. I never use half and half so I decided to use evaporated milk instead. I didn&apos;t want to waste the other 8 oz of evap milk so I just poured the 12 oz can into a 4 c measure and then filled with milk and heated it all. I didn&apos;t bother with adding some cold milk to the hot chocolate. Yum Yum, just what I wanted on a cool morning, thanks Jeanie Bean!"
5,"OMG - this is the best cocoa!!!  I made it as the recipe stated and it was overly sweet for my taste.  Then made it per the reviewers suggestions and it was much, much better!  Definitely decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup; your blood sugar levels will thank you!!!  Increased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon and a note of caution - DO NOT use cheap vanilla as you can taste the difference between good vanilla and the inexpensive type sold in the supermarket.  You&apos;ll be glad you did...  Thanks Jeanie for submitting this great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!!!"
5,"I am sipping this cocoa as I type this review.  It is very very good!  Much better than any crud you get in the packets, you know that there aren&apos;t any dyes or anything artificial in this which is why I choose to hand-make our cocoa.  
                                
                                I gave it a 5 star rating but it is  very, very sweet! And I have a sweet tooth!  ***AND*** I only used 1/2 C sugar.  I would definitey not use the 3/4 C, it will be too sickening sweet. 
                                
                                To make it less sweet you could either decrease the sugar amount further or add more hot water, I suppose.
                                
                                Overall great alternative to the store bought ""stuff""."
4,This cocoa was indeed creamy and tasty. Although my family found it entirely too sweet. The second time I made it I used a little less than 1/2 cup sugar and it was much better.
4,This recipe is from the Hershey&apos;s box with added sugar and half & half that&apos;s all. Ironically most cut the sugar to the same measurement as Hershey&apos;s. I must agree. I added 1/4 c of malted milk but will go with 1/2 c next time.
5,Best hot chocolate I have made and I have made several listed on this site. I did reduce the sugar but then turned around and added some Starbuck&apos;s mint syrup which is sweet. Heavenly! So rich it tastes like melted candy bars. Very creamy! Mmmm....
3,pretty good but very very sweet. next time i&apos;ll add less sugar and maybe use unsweetened chocolate pieces instead of the cocoa powder.
4,WAAAAAYYYYYYY too sweet. But great flavor otherwise. I will definitely keep the recipe just cut the sugar by 1/2.
5,Excellent and very easy.
5,"Easiest way to peel a butternut squash:
                                - Lay on side
                                - Cut into two halves, separating the ""large ball"" at the bottom from the ""tube"" at the top.
                                - Cut the bottom from the large ball so you have two parallel flat surfaces. Stand the ball on one flat face. Cut slices of skin off, from top to bottom, following the contour of the ball as you make each cut.
                                - Cut the top from the tube. Stand on one flat end. Cut slices of skin, from top to bottom.
                                - Only after both pieces are peeled - cut each half in half (top to bottom) to expose seeds, which you scrape out and discard."
5,"Not sure I&apos;d roast butternut squash any other way after making this basic, non-fussy recipe. Winning recipes almost always begin with fresh ingredients and a little seasoning to enhance and complement. This is a winner. Easy to prepare, quick to roast, easy to serve and eat, pretty on the plate, and delicious. I simply added a little fresh chopped parsley to pretty it up."
5,"How incredibly simply perfect.  Really top notch!  By the way, the easiest way to peel a butternut squash is with a plain old vegetable peeler.  Peel it, then cut off the ends, slice down the middle, scrape out the goosh and seeds and then chop it up per your recipe instructions.  Easy peezy!"
5,"Peeling tip: Before peeling, wash and poke holes in the squash, then put it in the microwave for 3 minutes. After it cools down a bit, you can easily cut and peel it."
3,"Simplest way to prepare a butternut or any other tough skinned squash is to roast it for 15 minutes, at about 150C, then you can cut it like butter, and the skin comes off very easily!
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                Another useful tip, to stop raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, grapes etc  from going mouldy!
                                When you get them home, rinse them in a bowl of water to which you add 2-3Tbs vinegar-any type. Swish very gently, then drain throughly. They don&apos;t need rinsing, but you can if you like-then they will keep in the fridge for a week maybe more!"
5,"YUM!  This was delicious.
                                
                                First of all, to the poster who recommended poking holes with a fork and microwaving the squash for 3 minutes, you are a genius of the highest order whom I shall worship for the remainder of my cooking life.  I was trying to explain to my boyfriend how hard it is to peel butternut squash, and I equated it to cutting down a tree with a butter knife - this tip made the job SOOOO easy.  I love you, wonderful poster.
                                
                                This recipe was so easy and so good.  I made three small changes - I added petite red skinned potatoes to the mix (cut the same size as the squash), added some fresh thyme and roasted the veggies just a bit longer - 40 minutes instead of 25.  
                                
                                I couldn&apos;t stop drooling and neither could my BF.  Definitely a keeper recipe!  Oh, and it tasted great the next day, too.  Yum."
5,Does anyone have any suggestions on how to peel easily.  Everything else was great.
5,"I have roasted butternut squash for vegetable soup recently but I had purchased one from the local farmer&apos;s market and needed a side dish with some (soy sauce/lemon juice/garlic/brown sugar) marinaded chicken breasts I planned on grilling.  I removed the skin of the squash and then cubed it.  Then I tossed it with the fresh ground pepper, drizzle of olive oil (probably closer to 1 tblspn), coarse sea salt and minced garlic.  I prepped it around 11am and stuck it in the fridge.  Come dinner time I pulled it out, placed it on a baking sheet lined with foil and baked for 30 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was delicious.  I told my 3 year old son how a local ""FARMER"" had grown it just for him to eat and he gobbled it up.  Eat great Fall veggies until you are so tired of them and then do it all again next fall.  They are nutritious and delicious and cost effective when in season.  I paid $2.00 for a large squash that will roll over to another meal.  ENJOY!!!  This one is going in the cookbook under ""Side dishes"" : )"
5,Loved this recipe! Able to stand on it&apos;s own with no changes.... Very nice indeed!
5,These are really good.  I have a few pointers.  Too make ingred. mix better together-- mix sausage with Biscuit THEN add cheese.  The ball don&apos;t have the powdery white appearance and they mix easier.  Also I like to cook these on parchment paper and they slide right off the paper.  Enjoy.
5,I learned how to make sausage cheese balls in high school and have used the same recipe for over 10 years. My family has requested these at every  baby and bridal shower until I have gotten sick of making them and even eating them. The only difference in the way I make them and this is that I cook them longer. They really need to cook for up to 25 minutes. Otherwise you end up with raw sausage in the middle. I have tried different brands of sausage and it makes a difference. Some are greasier than others and some are drier. And I have found that Aberdeen sausage (spelling?) (it may be Aberdeen Farms) works the best. You can find it at walmart and it usually is the cheapest. If the ones on the edge of your pan end up dry just put all the sausage balls in a covered container and let them sit covered until they cool. The steam will help the dry ones become moist. I always cover mine to cool to hold in the flavor even if they don&apos;t dry out because it seems to make them taste even better if the flavors mingle.
5,"These sausage balls were so good.  With 6 children, I don&apos;t cook spicy for them, but I did add a bit of black pepper and some dried chives to add some flavor.  However, I had to change the baking a bit.  The first batch I made came out SOO greasy (of course using uncooked sausage), even after laying them on a paper towel to drain and cool.  I took my cooling rack and placed it on a cookie sheet, then put the unbaked sausage balls on that.  When they cooked, the grease dripped down through the cooling rack into the pan below.  Because of the drippings, you will need to get a spatula to get them off the rack, but cooking them this way they have yet to burn!!  I cooked them for 25 minutes or so instead of 10 minutes like the recipe says.  After cooking them like this, my husband tasted them and said they were the best tasting sausage balls he had ever had.  My children ate them as fast as I was making them!!  I will be cooking them this way from now on.  We had these for Thanksgiving appetizers this morning!!  :)"
5,"I see so many reviews that say ""this was dry.. not enough liquid"", but if anyone actually read the instructions, they would see that nowhere it says to pre-cook the sausage. Its supposed to be raw. I guess the person who added it should have clarified that."
5,"outstanding!  i&apos;ve made sausage balls before but these were especially delicious & got many rave reviews.  i used hot sausage, extra-extra sharp cracker barrel cheese and grated it myself (i think this was the key), and the 2c bisquick.  i made about 60 good size balls.  i took the idea of some others and baked them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet to drain grease but also it kept them soooo moist!  i baked at 375 for about 18 minutes.  perfect!  thanks!!"
5,I tried this recipe but with one change..use stove top stuffing instead of baking mix..it adds so much flavor!!!!
5,"The great reviews of this recipe saved me a lot of aggravation with this one... thanks everyone! I left the sausage out for about 20 min. before starting the recipe and finely grated the cheddar cheese by hand... those were the two best ideas from the reviews. Then you really have to get in there with your hands (those disposable thin kitchen gloves work great for this part) and knead the dough. It was kind of fun actually :)  Also, as many reviewers have suggested, line your baking sheets with parchment. I had no sticking whatsoever. Finally, my own suggestion is to bake them longer than 10 min... I baked mine about 20 min., flipping them over after 10 min. This could partly be my oven&apos;s fault, but I&apos;d say you&apos;d at least want to bake for 15 min. There&apos;s nothing worse than an undercooked sausage ball... yuck! Anyway, the final results were very yummy and I&apos;ve got a lot left over in the freezer ready and waiting for Superbowl Sunday!!!"
5,I FOUND A GREAT EASY WAY TO MIX IS TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO A GALLON SIZE (OR LARGER) ZIP LOCK A KNEAD AWAY:) NO MESS AND NO DISHES TO WASH:)
5,"This is the recipe I&apos;ve used for 20+ years, adding another good handful more of cheddar. I can&apos;t believe some recommend to cook the sausage before mixing. No, you do NOT cook the sausage first! Your sausage balls will be dry and lacking the flavor the grease gives them during baking. Just toss them in a paper-towel lined bowl to absorb any excess grease afterward. If you use nice sausage (it really is worth a buck or two more), you won&apos;t have the super greasy problem to begin with. If you live in the southeast, look for Neese&apos;s Hot Sausage (the BEST!). Failing that, Jimmy Dean is fine (don&apos;t go lower in quality than that, tho). Set the ingredients out an hour ahead of time. You have to use some muscle to get it totally blended. You&apos;ll know it&apos;s ready when you can smoosh it into one big old smooth mass that isn&apos;t crumbly or dry.  DON&apos;T add liquid if it seems dry - that isn&apos;t the problem! The warmth of your hands and the kneading will do the trick. Just keep at it; it&apos;ll end up just right. I make mine large-marble size (ends up walnut size after baking) and cook about 15 mins. This is THE recipe to try. Don&apos;t use tons of baking mix or add liquids like some recipes call for. Use parchment/silpat; the bottoms won&apos;t over-brown or stick. For heaven&apos;s sake - whatever you do - DO NOT precook the sausage! :)"
3,"I followed this recipe EXCEPT I did NOT cook the sausage in advance.  If you do that, the sausage balls do not have a grease to help the bisquit mix cook while baking.  I just mixed everything together in a bowl and then baked.  Turned out wonderful.  Also - use a flavorful sausage for better tasting rolls."
5,"HOORAY! SUCCESS AT LAST!  After 2 successes and 2 ""almost"" successes( my butter pooled on top twice) I read about 50 reviews, applied all the tips and had perfect toffee.  Here are all the tips you need for success too: test your thermometer in boiling water (212f)to be sure it&apos;s accurate.  Use a heavy, large pot or pan (I used a 4 quart nonstick pot).  Melt butter/sugar on medium/high heat, whisking the WHOLE time (I used a flat whisk that allowed me to get edges incorporated in very well). Let come to a steady, but NOT rolling boil, at about medium heat, and continue to stir frequently.  At medium heat it really shouldn&apos;t burn. Last, keep temping toffee until thermometer says 285-295...at 285 do the ice water test by dropping a dot of toffee into some ice water...it should be brittle.  If so, it&apos;s done.  It will be a very dark amber color. Pour into foil lined pan, put on chocolate and nuts and, VOILA!  Perfect toffee!!  Refrigerate before breaking apart!  I also keep it in a cool place (fridge or in an airtight container in the garage, in the winter, then it&apos;s extra brittle :))."
5,"I have been making this toffee for 40 years.  I cook it until 300 degrees.  You have to stir constantly or it burns.  Also, I make it in a 9x13 or 10x14 pan.  I butter the bottom of the pan, spread the crushed almonds over the butter and pour the toffee mixture over that. I sprinkle the chocolate chips on top, let them melt and then spread.  Mmmm, good"
4,"(Here is a hint)! Before you pour on the melted chocolate over the toffee, wipe off the excess oil with paper towel, so that the chocolate will stick better."
4,The butter started to seperate from my toffee and I panicked. I continued cooking it up until 300 and then poured off some of the butter before putting in my pan. I really did not think it would turn out. However I still put on the chocolate and almonds and it tastes fantastic! My mistake was following another reviewers suggestion. I stirred the toffee constantly. You should stir frequently but NOT constantly. Stirring too much will cause seperation. If you have not been stirring constantly and it seperates try lowering the heat a bit and slowly stirring to get the sugar and butter to re-combine. You can also add 1/4 c. to a half a cup of water 1 Tablespoon at a time to help the butter re-mix.
5,"Toffee came out excellent! My mom, who was an expert candy maker, taught us that boiling sugar like in this recipe requires OCCASIONAL stirring. This recipe states to ""STIR OCCASIONALLY"" so follow the recipe. Some women who are not familiar with making candy want to stir and stir because that&apos;s what we know, but boiling sugar for candy does not require a lot of stirring. Always use a wooden spoon, no metal (changes the temp). The reason the butter separates: by stirring and stirring you&apos;re cooling the sugar down and not allowing it to get hot and cook. Do not take a spoon and scrape the sides of the pot ""above"" the boiling line, that&apos;s where the sugar crystalizes. If you scrape, your candy will come out gritty. Hopefully this helps."
5,"As a professional Chef, I say mom2oovc has the best directions.  It is very important to remember the following:
                                1. The pot MUST be ""heavy-bottomed"". It allows for the best even heating. Constant stirring should not be necessary at a medium heat.
                                2. At medium heat it should take about 20 minutes to reach 285F. If your temp is rising faster than that, your heat is too high. 
                                3. Remember to consider your sea level. High sea levels affect your results.
                                3. Butter pooling or separation is caused from cooking too fast at too high a temp.  At medium heat you will not have this problem.  It is better to heat at a lower temp and adjust if it is taking more than 20 minutes to reach 285. The temp will rise faster in the beginning and slow as it reaches higher temps. Don&apos;t rush it!
                                4. 285F is ""soft crack"" meaning your toffee will be more pliable or chewy when cooled.  The higher you take it (300-310F), the harder and more brittle the candy will be when finished.
                                5. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER!  The boiling water method is best (212F), but remember to take sea levels into consideration! Don&apos;t let your thermometer rest on the bottom of the pan, but about 1/2"" above it."
5,Wonderful easy toffee recipe! I always like to add a few nuts to the bottom of the pan before pouring in the toffee mixture. Gives the toffee that little extra edge of flavor. Side note: using a large baking sheet will make for a thinnier toffee bottom use a small cookie sheet if available. This recipe is definitely a keeper and great for gifts during the holidays for those friends who do not cook/bake!
5,"Excellent! I found the solution to the butter separation! Make it in a wide, shallow pan, like a cast iron skillet, and use a metal slotted spoon to whisk the mixture in an up and down motion, making sure to incorporate the separated butter on the sides of the pan. My butter started to separate, but this helped tremendously to incorporate it back  into the sugar. I added vanilla, extra salt, and topped with a dark 60% cocoa chocolate and chopped pecans.  Perfect!"
5,Delicious. I used 2 sticks of butter and 1 cup dark brown sugar (or light brown) and added a splash of vanilla and the 1/4 tsp. salt. Poured into 2 9inch cake pans sprayed with pam. Turned out great with or without chocolate and nuts. Use the heaviest pan that you have; I have Le Crueset and it helps prevent hot spots. EDIT 12/23/08: Made a batch with the original measurements (usually make 1/2 batch). Needed to use 3 cups brown sugar for the 2 cups butter. DIdn&apos;t add chocolate just pecans. Much easier to make a half-batch but was still AMAZING toffee. 12/09/09: Made tonight and added a generous pinch of sea salt and press very finely chopped walnuts into toffee with the back of wooden spoon.:)
1,"Like pralines...too soft, too bland.  
                                Toffee has to be cooked to 300 degrees or to the hard crack, or 12 minutes boil to where it is truly brownish.  I made it years ago from a recipe and it was perfect but here I couldn&apos;t remember the recipe.  I used this recipe but it was all wrong.  If you want a soft praline-like taste then this is it.  If you want genuine toffee, cook it to the hard crack.  I found the real recipe from Betty Crocker, and that is 1 cup butter, 1 cup sugar, not double. 1/8 tsp salt.  However, instead of spreading it on a cookie sheet (unless you just like it paper thin), I recommend pouring it in a lined rectangular cake pan in order to achieve the thickness of a real Heath bar.  Still spread a cup or cup and a half of chips with the back of a spoon, then add any chopped nuts of your choice.  Set naturally or refrigerate for a short while, then break into bite sized pieces.  This is genuine toffee with the genuine flavor, not some spruced-up praline.  Do NOT use a plastic spoon in this recipe.  Use a wooden spoon.  The plastic one will melt into the candy.  I don&apos;t recommend this recipe because it is tasteless and not at all toffee-flavored.  It is sugary and like a praline."
4,"I reduced the amount of cereal to 8 cups, and added 1/4 cup butter and 1 tsp of vanilla to it.  I cooled it slightly in the fridge before tossing with the powdered sugar so it doesn&apos;t absorb it so much...coats better with less.  This is soooo adictive.  I can&apos;t make it unless I know there are people here to help me eat it or it&apos;s gone before I know it!
                                
                                ****Here&apos;s a tip, line your measuring cup with saran wrap before mesauring the peanut butter.  It will slide right out with no messy clean up! I do this for all sticky ingredients (shortening, honey, pb, corn syrup)  Works great!***"
3,"I had made puppy chow before but with a different recipe.  This recipe definitely needed more chocolate.  I would recommend a 12 oz bag vs. 1 cup of chips.  Using only 1 cup did not coat the cereal nearly enough to make the ""puppy chow"" consistency [the chex squares did not stick together]!"
5,"I love this recipe. The only thing that I would add is that you can microwave the chocolate peanut butter mixture instead of heating on the stove. It makes it much easier. Just microwave for a minute, stir, then microwave for 30 seconds. It works great. Remember to use a microwave safe bowl. Love the recipe. Great snack for kids sleepovers and snacks at lunch."
5,"Cute story to tell...  I had a gathering and offered some Puppy Chow to 4 yr-old Anthony.  He asked what was in it.  I told him it was Chex cereal that had melted chocolate and peanut butter poured on it.  Then it was tossed in powdered sugar.  He says ""Oh no... I couldn&apos;t possibly eat that.""  Thinking he was allergic to something I kind of freaked and asked why not.  He put his little hand to his chest, took a step backwards and said ""Because it sounds too delicious.""  FOUR YEARS OLD!  Needless to say, I had to give the kid a hug.  Anthony proceeded to gobble it up and even took a doggy bag (which he thought was hilarious) home for his brother."
5,"I made this with one full 16 oz. box of Rice Chex, a full bag of chocolate chips, and one cup of p/b.  Because of this large quantity, I had to move the sauce from the saucepan to a very large bowl to stir everything.  What an easy way to make delicious snacks for a large group!  And it&apos;s SOOO good!"
4,"Really great! A few suggestions. I added half a stick of butter so that the chocolate mixture would be more fluid (thus, easier to spread). 9 cups was WAY too much cereal to coat each piece of cereal completely, so I&apos;d go with 7 or 8. Really great otherwise =)"
5,LOVE this recipe! I have found that using a paper grocery bag works better for coating the chow with the powdered sugar though. Just a little note.
5,Coming across this recipe brought a smile to my face and evoked years and years of delightful memories with my children--classroom treats sleepovers birthday parties...even finding pieces of Puppy Chow underneath their beds! This is a treat I&apos;m sure that has pleased millions of kids and adults alike. The original recipe adds 1/4 cup of butter melted with the chocolate chips and peanut butter in the microwave for about a minute and a half stirring after one minute. Then stir in 1 tsp. of vanilla. Once laid out on waxed paper the challenge is to wait until the Puppy Chow (or Muddie Buddies) is cool before you start nibbling!
4,I had always made this recipe with a stick of butter. I was surprised how tasty it came out with less fat! I did add extra peanut butter to make one cup(to have an even chocolate peanut butter taste.) and just stuck it all in the microwave to melt for a couple minutes.
5,"This is a great recipe but I think that people that aren&apos;t familiar with sugar cooking need to know that it is very difficult to make a recipe like this on an electric stove and they need to understand more about sugar crystalization. One sugar crystal in the pot after it is cooked will ruin the candy. I always make sure that I take a wet paper towel and wipe down the sides of the pot after the mixture comes to a boil to remove any undissolved sugar; I never put a spoon into the mixture after it comes to a boil (it might have sugar crystals on it) and I never stir or move the fudge after it is cooked (do not stir the butter and vanilla into it) until it is cooled to at least 115 degrees. Then, and only then, beat like mad until it loses it&apos;s gloss and then pour it quickly into your pan. It shouldn&apos;t take a long time to reach the desired temperature if the size of the pot is large enough and if it&apos;s heavy enough it will not burn. It takes about 10-15 minutes from beginning to end of cooking for me."
5,Very difficult to make properly. I butter sides of pot after sugar is poured in so it lessens the chance of crystallization. I recommend reading further (top) reviews to ensure you follows steps properly
5,"Best fudge ever…hands down. Every time I make this, people say it&apos;s better than in the specialty fudge shops. I use Ghirardelli cocoa and I add a couple dashes of salt to cut the sweetness a bit. I never use a candy thermometer. Depending on the quality, they can be unreliable. I keep a shallow dish of ice water near the pan and test it periodically. I think a lot of people have failed results, because they aren&apos;t sure what exactly ""soft ball"" stage is. When you dribble the chocolate mixture in the water, it should not cloud, and will immediately form a semi-solid mass. Think of it as the consistency of a tootsie roll you&apos;ve been keeping in your pocket all day. When you squeeze it, it should be soft, but you don&apos;t want it to run. Once it&apos;s reached this stage, beat the hell out of it with a wooden spoon and Voila! Gourmet fudge. It&apos;s worth the sore elbow."
3,"I have the original Hershey tin can the recipe is on and it is a little different from this one.
                                
                                2/3 Cup Hershey&apos;s Cocoa
                                3 Cups sugar
                                1/8 teas. Salt
                                1 1/2 Cups milk
                                1/4 Cup Butter (1/2 stick)
                                1 teaspoon Vanilla
                                And follow her recipe when cooking it.
                                
                                I have made this fudge for many years."
5,"Excellent recipe. At the end, I was left with a lot of very hard, crusty remains in the pot. I was going to soak it and hope for the best but then I came up with a better idea. To clean the pot, add some milk and reheat it, while swirling it around and scraping the sides. It will all come off and you will end up with the best mug of chocolate you’ve ever had. And an utterly clean pot. I recently had a $5 mug of hot chocolate a local luxury chocolatier, and it was indistinguishable from the one I made last night with all the leftovers in the pot. Why soak it with soapy water  when you can make yourself a free mug of utterly decadent hot chocolate?"
5,"I&apos;ve made it twice-loved it both times! I used to watch my grandmother make fudge when I was little. I&apos;ve ruined a few batches on my own.  There is nothing wrong with this recipe. You just have to be careful. Fudge can be frustrating to make. Thanks for all of your helpful tips.
                                1st batch came out just as I remember it. Firm, but not rock hard, and not sugary either. I was concerned, because it was snowing at the time I made it.
                                2nd batch: Snowing again. And this time I wanted it to be JUST a hair softer than before, so I took it off of the heat sooner. Too soon. It took forever to set. Both times I took it off of the heat and immediately added the butter, mixed it in, and then added the vanilla. The first time it didn&apos;t take too long to beat the sheen off of it. The second time it wasn&apos;t done, but I&apos;m SO glad I didn&apos;t give up and throw it out! I got out my hand mixer and just mixed and mixed it...I&apos;m guessing I mixed it for at least 20 minutes until it lost it&apos;s sheen! I kept going because I could tell that as it cooled it was thickening. The second time was much softer, and not as good as the first at all. But still worth the effort.
                                I make mine on an electric flat top stove with a thermometer and the cold water test-no stirring after it comes to a boil. 
                                I just wanted to list both of my experiences in case somebody was tempted to throw out your fudge if it didn&apos;t seem to be setting."
5,"This is the same as the old world french fudge recipe that&apos;s been in my family for generations.  It does take precise timing, strong arms for the beating stage, and even a little practice.  But even the failures are delicious, testing the gooey soft-balls is fun in itself, and scraping out the pan is one of my favorite childhood memories.  This is a different world of fudge than the marshmallow creme/chocolate chip concoctions so popular now, and has a much more RICH, deep cocoa flavor.  Growing up with this fudge, I&apos;ve never understood the appeal of the &apos;quick & easy&apos; recipes, as fudge for us was a tradition.  I wouldn&apos;t recommend doubling the recipe in the same pan, as it&apos;s hard to beat as it is."
5,"I&apos;ve been making almost exactly this recipe for 25 years using 3 cups of sugar instead of two and 1/2 cup of butter divided. It always turns out perfectly. I always add 1/4 cup of butter to the pot in the beginning and a TBSP of corn syrup once it reaches a boil. Sifting the cocoa with the sugar blends it well and helps avoid cocoa balls. I&apos;ve never bothered to let it cool after reaching the desired temp, just remove it from the heat and plop in the butter and vanilla and start stirring.
                                For reference, I never use the softball method, too arbitrary. Get a good candy thermometer, and if you are new to this, cook it to 240 F.. You&apos;ll have to stir it for quite a while after removing it from the heat. If you want to shorten the stirring time a little, cook it to 242 F. but wait to do this until after you&apos;ve made it a few times. No higher temperature than this though, otherwise you&apos;ll be making a rock. 
                                When to stop stirring? A lot of recipes will tell you to pour when the shine comes off but I find that&apos;s a little late. 
                                For the record, the stirring is absolutely necessary. The stirring forms long crystals of sugar. The longer and more plentiful they are, the finer the grain of your fudge.
                                Lastly, this recipe claims to make 60 pieces...um, nope, more like 18 to 24."
5,"This recipe was on the Herschey&apos;s cocoa can for many years and I made it back in the 50&apos;s when I was a young girl. The marshmallow, chocolate chip recipe came out in the early 60&apos;s. I like it too, but to me it&apos;s not true chocolate fudge.As others have stated, you must leave it to cool to 110 degrees before adding butter and vanilla and then beating."
4,"A good starter recipe.  Really no need to boil the potatoes first....that&apos;s just another pan to wash.  I use an electric skillet.  Melt a little butter and add a little oil.  Throw in the diced potatoes, with the skin on, and as much sweet onion as you like.  I use vidalia or mayan.  Skip the green pepper.  Then just get happy with the spices.  We like celery seed, a touch of cumin, a dash of paprika, salt and pepper, garlic powder, whatever we happen to grab.  It always comes out deelish.  Definitely good for breakfast, lunch or anytime.  For dinner we might throw a little gravy and maybe some shredded cheese on them.  Always crispy if I leave the lid on.  I don&apos;t have the problem another reviewer has with them not crisping.  Maybe it&apos;s the nonstick electric skillet....don&apos;t really know."
5,"Finally the perfect fried potatoes. I have been trying to make fried ""taters"" and they always either come out too mushy, or not done enough. I was scanning through recipes and came across this one where you boiled the potatoes a little bit first before frying. I tried it and it worked perfectly. Have done it several times and they came out perfect every time!!
                                I used regular potatoes and fried with a little onion..served with pinto beans and corn bread
                                
                                Thank you!"
4,Great recipe! I left out the green pepper as I didn&apos;t have any on hand. I added a little garlic and used smoked paprika instead of regular to give it a different flavor - excellent!
4,"Great flavor-I modified the recipe by cutting the potatos first and microwaving them for 8 minutes, instead of boiling them; it cut down on time (and the mess!!!)"
5,"WOW! Did this recipe get some activity this past week (smile:))! All the publicity promted me to make these for lunch to go with our homemade corndogs. I followed another&apos;s advice and used regular baking potatoes, which I peeled, cubed and then cooked in the microwave for apprx 10 min (just to speed up the process so that they would better match the cooking time of the corndogs I was making).  Also, I added half of a chopped, red bell pepper. This tastes just like those O&apos;brian potatoes you can purchase in stores and although those are a little more convenient, the taste of these are much better. I sprinkled a little cheese to melt over my serving while my boyfriend and daughter used their extra ketchup from their corn dogs with theirs. A good side to any meal: B/L/D! Thanks Verona!"
5,"I had a craving for some home fried potatoes and this recipe hit it on the nose for perfection. First I microwaved some regular potatoes-much easier.  Then I peeled(I prefer no skins) and when cooled chopped into little cubes.  Next I chopped up 1/2 green pepper, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 onion into little cubes and sauteed in my electric skillet with some olive oil for 3minutes then added a couple of dabs of butter and sauteed for another 2 minutes.  In went the potatoes with black pepper, salt, paprika, garlic powder and whatever spice you like and  mix it all up and I added a few more dabs of butter(love butter).  I let it cook for 10 minutes or more on each side on med/low setting.  Easier for me to break it up in sections with spatula in the skillet to flip it over- so each side is nice and brown.  A must try-YUMMY!!!!"
4,I scaled this recipe to feed 35 people and it turned out great. Great recipe for a breakfast or brunch.
5,"Your absolutely right Verona...these are yummy!  We don&apos;t add the veggies (although they would taste great), but fry the potatoes in bacon grease.  I hope no one&apos;s heart skipped a beat when they read that.  But it is delicious!!  Try this with biscuits and grave..a real southern meal."
5,YUM! Just like O&apos;Brian style potatoes that my mom used to make. I used green & red bell peppers. The smell of these awoke the kids this morning they smelled so good! Thanks Verona!
3,I found this recipe to be just so-so as written. A few extra spices and it could be wonderful.
5,"really easy and yummy!
                                IMPORTANT NOTE: if you want it to taste like true restaurant style, you need to put the rice only in a pot over high heat and stir it around for about 5 minutes or so before cooking. it helps the grains of rice to stay separate (more like restaurant style) and less sticky. i also used frozen peas/carrots from a bag..worked great!"
5,"This is a great recipe! The only thing I want to add is that to get that authentic ""taste"" of restaurant fried rice, you should add about half a bottle of Oyster Sauce. Easily found in the asian section at the grocery store. Back off on that much if it tastes too strong, but after years of living in Japan and trying many versions of fried rice recipes, oyster sauce is the ticket!"
4,"I found this quite tasty after a few adjustments.  I cooked it in beef broth instead of the water and added a little minced garlic, grated ginger, sesame oil and green onions!  Just like the restaurant!!  Yum!"
3,"I like the ingredients, and the finished dish is fine with some cooking method changes.  Start with your rice cooked and COLD.  Not necessary to cook the peas at all.  Don&apos;t scramble the eggs with the vegetables -cook them separately in a small saute pan like a crepe.  Once cooled, roll the thin egg pancake up like a cigar, then cut it into shreds, chiffonade-style. I also added some chopped green onion and small, cooked shrimp.  Small but important preparation changes result in a better, 4-star outcome."
4,"I truly liked this recipe, but I found that it is 100% necessary to prepare the rice a day ahead of time.  That extra day is everything to this recipe, in my opinion."
5,"My first attempt ever at fried rice and it was really good. I took the advice of others and used frozen pea&apos;s and carrots, I heated the wok and used olive oil sauteed 1/2 onion then added veggies then rice, to be exact I used 1/3 c. soy sauce, and it was plenty for our taste. My husband really liked it and ate nearly half of what I made. Thanks for a great recipe, will make again."
5,"I have learned that I must double or even triple this recipe because everyone who tries it...can&apos;t get enough of it! It is better than any restaurant I&apos;ve ever been to! The only change I have made is to boil the rice in Chicken or Beef broth, it really brings out the flavor! I only use frozen mixed veggies too. Last night I even added a can of Tiny Shrimp. Absolutely Delicious! This is an amazing recipes! Thanx Jostrander!"
3,"I was in a hurry the first time I made this, so I didn&apos;t check the reviews like I usually do before I try something new. I have to admit when following the instructions as written, I really wasn&apos;t impressed.  Frying the rice after cooking it made it very glutanous and the soy to taste left me feeling like I was guessing.  Today I went back read the reviews and tried again and this time I loved it.  1.) Mixed 1/3 c. lite soy, several drops of sesame oil (or oyster sauce), and 3 2/3c. chicken broth in a large measuring cup and set aside.  2.) Rinsed the rice in a colander under cold running water for two minutes to wash off some of the gluten.  3.)  Heat 1/4c. canola oil in a heavy bottomed pan over med. high heat and add rinsed rice.  Stir constantly until golden.  4.) Add the soy/broth mixture, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.  5.) In a separate pan, fry the eggs, heat the peas and carrots and any other add ins. Set aside.  6.) Add the egg mixture to the rice when the rice is done.  For us, frying the rice before adding the liquids really does make all the difference."
4,"This is my default fried rice recipe as I like the carrot/pea combo, but any meat/veggie can be added to make it a meal in itself.  Usually I use leftover rice, shred the carrots and leave the peas frozen as they thaw rather quickly.  For the eggs, I don&apos;t scramble them; instead I mix the eggs with a bit of water/pepper/soy then leave them to cook flat in the pan.  When cooked through, I roll the circle o&apos; egg up and cut chiffonade-style, adding the shreds to the pan after seasoning the rice and veggies with soy sauce.  Any way it&apos;s made, it&apos;s all good... thanks!"
5,"Gets folks laughing! Worth the effort.
                                Tips (from me & others): use herbed or ranch flavored whipped cream cheese (it will still look white); don&apos;t simply slice the olive, remove a small section to accomodate the filling; pipe whipped cream cheese using a sandwich bag; make ""beaks"" thin to avoid splitting the ""head"" while inserting them; try inserting ""beaks"" vertically rather than horizontally; ""heads"" take the most time - make them the night before and leave them soaking in the olive brine. Don&apos;t forget to make baby penguins! Fill a single olive & set on top of carrot feet with large whole facing up. Insert toothpick through center to pin it to the ""feet"". Set ""beak"" into cream cheese filling of large whole - it will hold it in place. Do a variation on this to make ""swimming"" penguins. Fill a single olive. Stick beak in one end and feet in the other. Shave off a small portion from the underside of the olive to keep it from rolling around. For ""environment"" we used an aluminum pizza pan and foam board ($1.99)for an ice flow. Trace the pan on the foam board. Cut out the circle with a craft knife. Cut circle in half jaggedly to simulate ice flow. Cut remaining half into pieces; glue and stack in layers to create ""hills"". Cover pizza pan with blue plastic wrap. Place ""ice flow"" into the pizza pan. Tape plastic wrap to bottom of the pan to hold it in place. When placing penguins, push the toothpick into the foamboard to hold them in place. Transports easily this way."
5,These were really a hit with the kids at our Christmas family gathering. Instead of using frilly toothpicks I went to a party store and purchased the toothpicks with the flags from diferent countries. I also made a cheese ball in the shape of an igloo and placed my little guys all around it. Very cute!
5,"These are too adorable!!  I added some garlic powder to the cream cheese for a little flavor.  Also, I heated the cream cheese briefly (about 20 seconds) in the microwave and then put it in a ziploc bag.  By cutting off a small corner of the bag, you can easily squeeze the cream cheese into the olive using the ziploc like a pastry bag!"
5,This was a great recipe! It was a hit at a family picnic I made it for. I was able to get 25 penguins out of a can of jumbo olives. For the beaks I had to cut a horizontal slit into the smaller olives and I sliced the beaks thinner so they would fit better. I made these the night before and was worried they would get dried out so I stood them up in a tupperware container and placed a small amount of water in the bottom and sealed the top. They were fine the next day. They took about an hour to make. I needed to transport them safely on a two-hour car ride so I used the top and bottom of an egg carton and leaned the penguins on their backs in each section of the egg carton which worked great and prevented them from shifting and getting stuck together. I used an herbed cream cheese spread which worked well. A couple people thought they were chocolate covered treats so you may want to tell people they&apos;re olives! I&apos;ll definitely make these again!
5,"This is my favorite recipe for the winter holiday season and I make it for each and every party I attend. It definitely takes a little practice to get the penguins assembled correctly but after about 5 it&apos;s a snap. My boyfriend helps me make them and we get an assembly line going. One thing I do to add some flair is to use a basic frosting pump (same thing you would use to fill deviled eggs) to squirt the cream cheese into the olives. This creates a ""ruffled tuxedo"" effect down the penguin&apos;s front. These are always a hit and each penguin will have its own personality! People can never get enough of these. You can also make an ""igloo"" to sit next to the penguins out of cream cheese. Use a toothpick to draw the ice bricks."
5,"Stuffed olives with cream cheese has always been a favorite of mine but I would never have thought to shape them like a penguin. CUTE! I like to use the ""onion & chives"" flavored cream cheese. It gives an added flavor. To easily get the cream cheese into the olives I use a pastry bag with a #12 tip. I&apos;ll now need to buy a smaller tip to fill the smaller olives. Great recipe!"
5,I made these darlings for my sister&apos;s wedding shower and they were a smash hit! We arranged them in rows and they looked like an adorable little army! One suggestion would be to add dry ranch mix to the cream cheese to add a little flavor. Great party appetizer!
5,One quick suggestion for an easier scarf. Use a potato peeler and peel thin strips of carrot. Wraps easier and coordinates with the feet and beak!
5,"These are hilarious! My friends and I made them for a ""girls"" night and giggled all the way through. So fun! I found that putting a little cream cheese on the carrot bottom (feet) made the body stick better. And the thicker the slices the more they stand up on their own. Not too thick though because you don&apos;t want an overwhelming carrot flavor.."
2,They turned out looking really cute but that was about all they were good for. They were not very tasty.
4,"I tried this one, but find my old recipe easier and works better.  My changes - no oil necessary, use 10 candy canes instead and do not allow the first layer of chocolate to set before adding the white layer - this is what causes them to separate! I use about 12 oz of each chocolate and melt in the mirco in glass dishes.  First, melt the dark or milk chocolate, add extract if desired and pour into a foil lined pan, sprinkle with 1/3 of the crushed candy canes.  Refrigerate about 5 minutes while you melt the white chocolate, also in the micro but only half power for about 3 minutes. Pour the white choc over the top and then add the rest of the candy canes.  Be careful when spreading the white choc or you will end up swirling the 2 chocs together a bit and not have the pretty all-white top.Refrigerate for 2+ hours.  Turn upside down onto a towel and peel off the foil and break into pieces.  By breaking it from the back, you will not break as many of the candy canes on top.  Also, don&apos;t crush the candy canes too much or you will end up with powder instead of nice pieces.  Store in fridge."
5,This was so easy and fun to make! It tastes great and looks pretty. I did do a few easy cheats. I used a bag of whilte chocolate chips and a bag of chocolate chips. I microwaved the chocolate. I put the oil and the chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and cooked them for 1 minute on 50% power. Took it out and stirred it and put it in again for another 30 second or so on 50% power again. It came out really nice and smooth.
5,"very easy to make, very yummy and a very good gift to give... I did do this as directed the first time but found a few changes couldn&apos;t hurt. I found that using candy canes gave it a much better look. it crushes more to the red side verses the round are more to the white. I also added in 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract to give it a kick to the white chocolate mix after I had melted the chocolate. I also freeze it until I am ready to eat or give out as gifts and it tastes great! This is very simple, very easy to make. the price to make this is so much better then buying it to give out as gifts. When coming from your kitchen how can anyone not like it? Thank you for sharing this is a kepper that I will not use every holiday season."
5,"YUMMY!!! I didn&apos;t have any mint extract, so when I crushed the candies, I sifted them and took all the crumbs that fell through and melted them with the white chocolate. Then I sprinkled the rest on top and it was delicious!"
5,Delish! The only word of advice I would offer is that if you put peppermint pieces in between the layers don&apos;t put many. I put a good amount in between the layers and when I went to break up the pieces the white chocolate layer came off from the semisweet layer. They still taste fabulous but aren&apos;t all together liked planned. I can&apos;t wait to try it with milk chocolate as well!
3,I made this with 1/4 tsp peppermint extract only in the chocolate layer and I thought that much extract alone is entirely too much. I tried a similar recipe with no extract and it was perfect. If you don&apos;t really like peppermint (or the flavor of peppermint extract for that matter) I STRONGLY recommend omitting the extract altogether. I do like the flavor of the semi-sweet chocolate with the white chocolate. I would give this five stars but the peppermint extract flavor nearly ruined it for me. Definately five without the extract but three is being generous for the recipe as written. Another helpful hint it doesn&apos;t specify but you need to either use the peppermint on the first layer sparingly or really press it into the semi-sweet chocolate layer. When I cut these the two layers separated on several which was pretty aggravating.
5,Yummy and easy to make!! It&apos;s also much cheaper than the kind made my Williams S!!!! Tip: Spread the melted chocolate into a diposable aluminum pan. There will be no need to grease the pan and the bark will be easy to remove by slightly bending the pan. Also use a pizza cutter to cut when the bark is not completely cooled solid. Thank you for the great recipe idea!!
5,Great recipe! I used candy canes instead. I also halved the peppermint extract based on other reviews and I wish I hadn&apos;t. Next time I will use all of the peppermint extract and put it in the white chocolate layer only. Also I only put the semisweet layer in the freezer while I melted the white chocolate and I didn&apos;t have any problems with them separating when I broke it apart. I will make this again!
5,I altered this recipe slightly as it was the basic recipe that I use to make homemade fudge every year during the holidays. I melted the first batch of semi-sweet chocolate added a can of sweetened condensed milk and some peppermint extract. I allowed it to see for about a half an hour to fourty minutes and worked on the second layer made of white chocolate. I prepared it the same way I did with the semi sweet and gently covered the first layer. The last or top layer was made with milk chocolate prepared the same way and spread gently over the white chocolate. I then chopped up a small box of candy canes and sprinkled them over the top. My husband loved it! By far this was the best fudge recipe I have ever made though it is extremely rich. I will definatly be making this again!
5,This was extremely smooth and tasty.  Will definitely make it again!  I left out the rum since we don&apos;t drink but left everything else the same.
5,"Great recipe.  I added only half the amount of eggs and less cream than the recipe called for and it was still delicious.  If the eggs curdle, place the mixture in a bowl on top of a large bowl of ice water and beat rapidly with an electric mixture and this should save your eggnog!"
4,"Whoa nelly! I used a double boiler for heating the milk. Instead of whisking the milk mixture into the eggs and then back into the double boiler, I just tempered the eggs with about 1/2 cup of the milk mixture, then whisked that into the double boiler. And I used one cinnamon stick instead of ground cinnamon and a little allspice. It was pretty strong last night. I can&apos;t wait to see how it ripens. So next time I will definitely cut down on the rum. Oh! And I did have a milk curdling problem in spite of using a double boiler and constantly stirring, so I just poured the milk mix into the blender and kept it running while I added the rum and cream.  Update!  I tried pumpkin pie spice this time around and did use less rum...perfect!!"
5,"So the negative reviews almost scared me away, but after I read ""If you don&apos;t like this recipe, you don&apos;t like eggnog."" I decided to give it a shot and they were RIGHT! I followed suggestions of using only 1 cup of sugar. It&apos;s definately sweet enough with only 1 cup. However, I did not add rum. I used 1 tsp of rum extract. Everything else I followed TO THE LETTER. Be very very careful not to burn the milk. When returning the mixture to saucepan, I was worried. Alot of people said the mixture coagulated. After 3 minutes went by (as suggested, on medium heat) the mixture was foaming but not ""thickening"". I wondered, how thick is thick? As soon as I saw a pudding-like &apos;chunk&apos; on my spoon I immediately removed the pan from heat and kept stirring. As it cooled, it thickened significantly.. it ended up like pumpkin pie filling before you cook it.  Hope this helps someone!"
1,"I am sooo so sorry but I nor my family that I had over for Christmas dinner liked this eggnog. It was too strong in the liquor taste. We couldn&apos;t drink it at all and believe me we are not a family of angels that don&apos;t drink. I went exactly by the recipe and even managed to not scorch the milk. I enjoyed making it but threw all of it out this morning. Is there an actual ""light rum"" like there is light beer? I used the clear colored rum that I would considered light and hope that wasn&apos;t what messed it up. If I ever get the nerve to make it again I will use less rum. Please let me know what I did wrong."
5,"Living in Belgium I can not buy eggnog at the grocery, in fact Belgians have not heard of eggnog!  I have found this recipe to be on of the best!  
                                I am now on a quest to introduce this eggnog to all of Belgium!!"
5,"great recipe!  1st time i&apos;ve made eggnog.  i wanted to make sure i got it right and looked at a lot of different recipes, tips and techniques.  alton brown, from good eats suggest to first beat the egg yolks by themselves until they are lighter in color.  he says this helps to keep the egg yolks from curdling later.  i followed this tip and no lumps or curdling at all.  he&apos;s sort of a scientific guy so he had a whole explanation for it.  YUM!"
4,good but we didn&apos;t cook the egg yolk mixture in the sauce pan.  and we also beat the egg whites until stiff peaks formed and then stired that into the eggnog to make it thicker and creamery.
5,"Yep, amazingly good stuff!!
                                I used half & half cream and a 1/4 less sugar. I seperated about 1/2 of it without the rum(for my nephew & me) and 1/2&apos;d the rum. 
                                A keeper to be sure ;-)
                                I made this again this year and it is soooo good. I only use 1/2 or less of the rum so it&apos;s not so overwhelming"
5,"I made this for my daughter&apos;s French class Christmas fete.  Yes it is alot of work but worth it. I followed other tips like beating the egg yolks a good 5 minutes, greasing the parchment paper very well and I put quite a bit of powdered sugar on the dish towel before rolling.  I had enough of the mousse left over to decorate.  Here&apos;s what I did and it was beautiful (will post a photo later).  I cut one end of the log (about 4"") at an angle.  Frost the sides, top and bottom and use some mousse to ""glue"" on the stump (piece cut off earlier) then frost the stump as well except for the top. Next run fork tines across the log and upward on the stump so you have ridges like a log. Then dust with powdered sugar and decorate with holly or mistletoe or pine sprigs.  I also made mushrooms from chocate truffles stuck onto a piece of broken candy cane rubbed with chocolate, and dipped in powdered sugar."
5,"This cake received applause at our Christmas dinner.  And, it should have.  After all, my mother and I had to make it twice.  Let me explain.  You MUST BEAT the egg yolks and sugar until they are very pale.  For all of you Texas Aggies out there, BTHO the egg yolks.  Let the electric mixer run at the highest speed for at least 5 minutes.  Because this cake contains no rising agents like baking powder or yeast, its ""fluffy-ness"" depends upon the amount of air that you ""BEAT"" into it - hence the stiff egg whites and the pulverized egg yolks. 
                                
                                We decorated the cake with whipping cream and homemade mushrooms (hershey kisses and small marshmallows on toothpicks - with red gel polka dots)."
5,"Wow, this was so tasty! Thanks to 1. the reviewers who recommended spraying the parchment paper with non-stick spray, 2. the reviewer who emphasized the importance of beating the eggs enough, 3. the reviewer who suggested rolling out gumdrops to make holly leaves, and 4. the reviewer who suggested using a fork to make lines that looked like tree bark. My bûche turned out like a work of art! And did I mention it was really tasty? Wow!!"
5,"I made this two days ago for the holidays. Incredible outcome! For anyone who has had trouble, make sure to follow all of the instructions AND the hints on the allrecipes page for this recipe. Remember, baking is a SCIENCE. There is NO FLOUR in this recipe! If you aren&apos;t getting the desired outcome, you are probably not beating the egg yolks/whites long enough. If there is no flour in something you are going to need to whip more air into the eggs to make the cake fluffy in the oven. Also make sure to let it cool a little bit before you try to roll it. The cake needs to set/solidify. Make sure to grease your pan, and make sure to use parchment paper and a towel coated in powdered sugar! Just basic hints, here, folks. If you care to see how mine turned out, click on the ""Photos"" and check for katelovesbaking&apos;s photo, its toward the end. :) For the mushrooms, I googled for a meringue mushroom recipe. It&apos;s very easy. I used a ziplock bag to pipe my meringue. For the green and red holly leaves/berries, my mum took gum drops and rolled them flat, and then used a knife to cut out the shapes! Good luck and have fun baking! :)"
5,This recipe was delicious. Only thing I do have to recommend is to spray the parchment paper otherwise you will never get it off....highly recommend this recipe to anyone and it may become a new christmas tradition in our house...
5,This recipe was easier than I had thought. The cake is dense and wonderfully chocolaty and chocolate whipped cream.....how can you go wrong. Made this for my Mom&apos;s birthday and it was thoroughly enjoyed. Try this recipe...you won&apos;t regret it. (Make sure you let the cake cool at least 10 minutes before turning it out on the towel)
4,"This was a really good recipe, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 4.  I down graded it because it needed to be a little more clear. The cake was nice and moist and my French students loved it! Here is what you need to know: 1. Grease the pan and the paper. 2. Beat the egg yolks until they are very very pale. The egg whites should be stiff enough to stand on the spatula. 3. Make sure the cake springs in the middle not just the edges. 4. Dust with lots of powdered sugar. 5. When you roll with the towel, roll the towel inside of the cake.  If you use the towel to roll the cake onto itself, it will stick and you might have issues. 6. Prepare this a day ahead. It is so much better the next day!  Thank you for the recipe. It is a keeper!"
4,Very rich but who cares!!! When serving after dushing with powder sugar we topped ours off with sliverd almonds but could also try shaved chocolate. We experienced the cake sticking to the dishtowel so will dust heavier next time.
1,Like a chocolate omelete with whipped cream. This recipe was identical to a recipe in one of my cook books except the flour was missing in this one....wanted to try with all the good reviews...But this was NOT what I hoped.
5,I was looking for something to bake on Christmas that was a little fancier than my standard cinnamon rolls. This was perfect. The dough is nice to work with and is very delicate and has fantastic flavor. The end result is very pretty- it&apos;s a shame we ate it before I thought to take a picture. A couple tips: Make sure to seal the seams very very well- it has a tendency to blow out. I couldn&apos;t find almond paste so I ran some sliced almonds and some butter in the food processor until it was smooth. I don&apos;t know if that is very authentic but it tasted great! If I could rate this a 4.5 I would for the following reasons: 1- The dough is very fattening with the heavy cream 2- The cardamom makes this relatively expensive to make
4,"Thank you very much for this recipe.  We had a bakery that baked these and I have been trying to figure out how to make them ever since it closed!
                                The directions were good but I don&apos;t think that the wiodth of the strip is meant to be 2"".  I ended  up making it 6"".  The dough was sticky so I put some flour on the waxed paper which helped.  The sugar coating helped to prevent it from sticking when I stretched the tube.  I think another time I would stretch it quite a lot farther to make a narrower Kringle.  We would put in less sugar and no almond extract and no cinnamon next time as well.
                                It is fussy, but it is very nice. Thanks again."
5,"My family loves marzipan things so I decided to try this last Christmas. It was a huge hit and now I&apos;m back this year to make it again! I wasn&apos;t able to find almond paste last year so I made my own which was VERY time consuming. So glad I found a can this year! The nice thing about this recipe is the tube can be shaped into something other than a ring. Last year I made a heart not sure what I&apos;ll do this year I may attempt a snowflake. I did make mine wider about 3-4""."
5,"This was a fantastic bread recipe! The dough is soft and flavorful but the almond paste filling puts it over the top! I made my own almond paste and rolled the dough out into two 12""x6"" rectangles which I then rolled up and formed into rings. I left out the sliced almonds because my kids won&apos;t eat nuts they can see and sprinkled the top with raw coarse sugar. I will absolutely be making this again!"
5,"Great recipe. I had some marzipan that I wanted to use. I more or less followed the recipe; I replaced the heavy cream with milk. I added vanilla sugar instead of cardamom. 
                                I separated one egg, brushed the egg white on the dough before I put the filling on. It helps the roll to stay together. After I let the bread rise, I brushed the egg yolk on the top and added sliced almonds."
5,This is delicious and fun to make! I was so excited to make this recipe. I made my own almond paste (not as hard as it sounds). I also only used the almond paste as the filling with sprinkling on some sliced almonds over the top of it and a little bit of cinnamon and sugar (I did not combine the almond paste 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon and almond extract together). The marzipan/almond paste is plenty sweet and already has almond extract in it so 1/2 cup sugar more is unnecessary (in my personal taste). I also wanted less of a cinnamon taste and more of an almond taste. One thing that helped with forming the pretzel shape was watching a you tube video on kringle. There is a bakery that shows how to shape it. The width of the dough should be 6 inches not 2 when you roll it out with the filling taking up the very middle 2 inches. Then fold over each side on top of the filling seal and pat out any air bubbles. Then kind of stretch the roll as you lift it and then shape like the pretzel (I didn&apos;t actually roll the dough into a log to stretch it or roll it in sugar at this point). After forming the pretzel shape I used the egg wash and sprinkled the top with raw sugar and the sliced almonds. Beautiful and delicious! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
4,This is a delicious bread but needs some clarification in the steps. First the dough will not rise at all in the fridge. This worried me but the bread rose beautifully once it was a loaf shape. Second it&apos;s very important that your filling is spreadable and not a powder. I used homemade almond paste and my filling was more of a powder than a paste which caused me problems. If I had it to do again I&apos;d have added an egg white to make it stickier. Third keep the dough refrigerated until right before you roll it out otherwise it will get sticky and will tear easily. Fourth when it&apos;s done baking it will still look a little doughy. I overcooked this because I thought it wasn&apos;t done and the doughier parts turned out the most delicious later on. The texture is closer to a coffee cake than a loaf of bread. I had a hard time rolling out the shape to the full 40 inches before the outer layer got thin enough to start tearing so at that point (probably about 30 inches) I just twisted it up into a loaf and let it rise. But in the end this was absolutely delicious. Moist and very very rich with beautiful flavors that complemented each other very well. Highly recommend and I will try it again now that I know how.
5,This bread is very very good. I&apos;ve made it twice now and it&apos;s gotten easier each time. I recently made it for a Christmas party and everyone LOVED IT and wanted the recipe!!!!!
5,I&apos;m still trying to figure out how to get filling in a 2in.wide strip.
1,Will not make again. Dough was too hard to roll out. Instructions were not good or complete.
5,"This cheesecake turned out great!  The changes I made was to add one cup of eggnog & an extra tablespoon of rum.  I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust.  I wrapped the bottom of the springform pan with foil and baked it in a water-filled cookie pan.  I baked it for the time specified and it came out perfect with no cracks.  I followed what someone else said and I beat 1 cup whipping cream with 3 T powdered sugar and then I added 1 tsp. rum extract & 1 tsp. cinnamon.  It really added to the eggnog flavor.  Also, I microwaved the cream cheese and eggnog just until it was at room temp. and I mixed everything with my kitchenaid stand mixer and this worked very well.  I&apos;ll definitely be making this every year for the holidays!"
5,"This cheesecake is FANTASTIC. I used helpful suggestions from the other reviewers to make modifications, and here&apos;s my advice:
                                1. I scaled the recipe down to 11 servings so it used 2 pkgs of cream cheese. I used one pkg of full-fat cream cheese and one pkg of light, and it still tasted wonderfully rich. 
                                3. I added about 3/4 to 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter, subbed 3/4 tbsp of vanilla extract for the rum (I didn&apos;t have any rum on hand), and used 1 cup eggnog. 
                                4. MAKE THIS CHEESECAKE THE DAY BEFORE YOU NEED IT (I can&apos;t stress that enough; this recipe improves with time, and the flavor is much better the second day). 
                                5. If you&apos;re using a store-bought graham cracker crust, there will be more batter than you need to fill the crust, so look up a ""crustless cheesecake"" recipe and use those directions for baking the excess batter. 
                                6. Use a water bath (I just filled a cake pan with water and put it on the bottom rack of the oven, below the middle rack where the cheesecake was).
                                7. When it&apos;s finished cooking, turn off the heat, open the oven door a bit, and let it cool in there for a couple hours before refrigerating.
                                
                                This recipe is fantastic - it&apos;s definitely going to be an Xmas staple from now on!"
5,"Excellent cheesecake! A great way to use leftover eggnog. I didn&apos;t have any rum, so I used vanilla extract instead - it still tasted as if alcohol had been added to it (DELICIOUS!). Since I didn&apos;t have a food processor big enough to fit the entire recipe, I used an electric beater. I made sure to beat the cream cheese mixture until very fluffy. It was so fluffy that I thought it would colapse after removing from the oven. To my surprise, it didn&apos;t. And, to give it a delicate flavor, I used crushed lady fingers in place of graham crakers. The final result was of a very light and creamy filling over a delicious crust. Perfect for making mini-sized cheesecakes (the kind that you can eat in 2 to 3 bites); a great addition to the finger-food menu of an elegant party."
5,"This may be the best cheesecake I&apos;ve ever made.  I brought this to our work holiday party and EVERYONE raved about it.  Not too sweet, great eggnog flavor.  I did a gingersnap crust instead of graham cracker and that complemented the nutmeg and eggnog beautifully and substituted vanilla extract for the rum.  It was very easy to make and the biggest hit I&apos;ve had at a potluck since I made chocolate bread pudding 4 years ago.  Definitely a keeper for holiday desserts."
5,"This is the most delicious cheesecake I&apos;ve ever had.  I&apos;ve made dozens of them, and people have started hiring me to bake them for their Christmas parties this year.  It always comes out perfectly, and is always a hit.  I use my KitchenAid mixer and let it mix for a good, long while until everything is smooth and creamy.  This recipe is to die for!"
5,"I made these cheesecake THREE times during December--that&apos;s how good it is. Here are my modifications: (1) use gingersnaps for the crust. Every time I made it someone raved about the crust. (2) Use 1 c. of eggnog not 3/4 c. Someone else recommended this and it works. Use more nutmeg than a pinch. (3) Use spiced rum if you have it. And finally when the recipe says ""remove from oven and immediately loosen sides "" do it. The first time I did not and it cracked heavily as it cooled. I spread whipped cream over the top and no one ever knew. But the next time I ran a knife around the sides and it didn&apos;t crack at all. Best if you can let it sit overnight. Easy and absolutely great for holiday desserts."
5,This cheesecake had a great consistancy - not too heavy yet satisfying in the way only cheesecake can be. I used the Pecan Caramel sauce from Eggnog Cheesecake I at this site - it has dark rum in it and was perfect. I also added some spices ( 1/4 tsp each of ginger nutmeg and cinnamon) to the crust. I don&apos;t have a food processor I just mixed the heck out of it with my stand mixer.
5,"SO good!  The perfect elegant, yet not too challenging holiday dessert.  I had plenty of eggnog leftover from making my yearly eggnog Christmas cookies and wanted to make a cheesecake for a family Christmas celebration, so it made perfect sense.
                                
                                I followed several different suggestions and made some minor adjustments to the original recipe.  I will admit, that although I&apos;ve made enough cheesecakes that I would say I&apos;m a fairly experienced cheesecake baker I have never prepared my batter in a food processor so I was a little nervous but since I already had the processor out to make my crust I thought I&apos;d give it a go, and it worked out great, plus I didn&apos;t dirty up my mixer!  
                                
                                The changes I made are as follows:
                                - for the crust I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg
                                - I upped the eggnog to 1 cup in the batter
                                - replaced the rum with 1 Tbsp vanilla extract
                                - added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg  to batter
                                
                                Also, unlike many of the users I did not use a waterbath, nor have I ever.  The consistency was great and no cracks!"
4,"When I set out to find an unusual holiday cheesecake recipe, I stumbled upon this one, which seemed like one of the easiest. Not only was it relatively easy, it was one of the smoothest, richest cheesecakes I&apos;ve ever tasted. The eggnog flavor lends itself very well to this classic dessert. In addition to an eggnog cheesecake, I used the basic recipe but substituted pure almond flavor for the rum and then swirled it with freshly grated ginger before baking. Both were superlative. Thanks for the great recipe."
3,I was really excited to try and make this and read all the reviews/suggestions before I made it. Next time I will bake it a little longer and I won t use rum extract but vanilla extract and cinnamon.
5,"For those of you who are hesitant to try this recipe because of the cost of Gruyere, I have a tip. Grate cheap grocery store brand Swiss cheese; it costs roughly $3 per pound instead of $18 or so per pound like Gruyere. Then pour about 3 T. of white wine over the 2 C. of the Swiss, toss, and let sit for at least 15 minutes. When ready to use, blot with a paper towel to remove excess wine, and it will remarkably cook up just like Gruyere. Your palate won&apos;t know the difference, but your pocketbook will!"
5,"The following is my review for this outstanding recipe that I reviewed when it was still a personal recipe. Reviewed on Nov. 22, 2011 by Avon
                                Thanks Celeste for the perfect, perfect au gratin potato recipe. Such a simple and yet elegant taste. Easy to put together and whatever you do, don&apos;t skimp on the ingredients. Use fresh ground nutmeg, the heavy cream, the yukon golds, and most of all the gruyere. It&apos;s not everynight of the week anyone needs to splurge on something so decadent, but for a special occasion or to make a meal memorable, just do i t. You won&apos;t be sorry."
5,"Potato perfection.   I chose to slice my potatoes a little thicker, perhaps between 1/8 and 1/4 inch, and only boiled them a few minutes to ensure they would not be reduced to mush.  I’d do so exactly the same next time.   These are, indeed, rich and creamy and develop a beautiful and extra delicious golden brown crust as they bake.  I loved the subtle flavor of the nutmeg (fresh does make a big difference I believe), which was an ideal choice to enhance, just slightly, the flavor of the potatoes as well as that gorgeous Gruyere cheese.  Not only were these a decadent  taste sensation, they were remarkably easy to assemble as well – no sauce to prepare, just layer cream and cheese!  After sampling these it will be interesting to see if I ever go back to traditional au gratin potatoes prepared with cheddar again."
4,"It was very good.  If you happen to have a Trader Joe&apos;s around town, get their cheddar/gruyere cheese blend and use that.  It was perfect and not as expensive as a pure gruyere cheese.  I also added some chives and seasoned the layers with a  salt blend.  Lastly I broiled the top for a bit to make it more crispy and pretty to serve."
5,Recipe Group selection 3/17/12. My only deviation from the recipe was using Jarlesburg in place of Greuyere which was 21.99/lb. This was so good with the lesser cheese I can just imagine it as written. Celeste this is another winning recipe thank you for sharing it with us.
5,"Made this for Recipe Group...This is potato perfection!!! I could not believe how easy this was to prepare and the end result was fantastic...everyone RAVED! I had planned a different potato recipe and at the last minute decided on these, so I had already had whole, boiled potatoes, so I just peeled them, sliced them thin and proceeded w/ the recipe. I seasoned them w/ some garlic powder and salt (as well as the pepper and nutmeg) to compensate for what I did not do during the boiling, which worked out fine. Also, and I know this is major, so PLEASE forgive me, but I actually only had a very small amount of Gruyere on hand that my mom gave me, so I did end up using some creamy Irish white cheddar (Ballyshannon) as well, and it went perfectly. These were so creamy and flavorful...a real hit at dinner. I will def be making these again and again (probably subbing cheeses as needed, lol). Thanks, Celeste, for this wonderful recipe. :)"
5,"Made this for Easter dinner, which meant there wouldn&apos;t be a lot of time to prepare it after the morning church service.  I made the entire dish up to the point where it was ready to bake the night before, then covered and refrigerated it overnight. I was worried the potatoes would be mushy, so I sliced them a bit thicker than the recipe called for, but they were just fine. They baked while I roasted the asparagus and tossed the salad, and were perfect. I loved the Gruyere in this, and would definitely make it again. This reminded me of the individual baked portions of au gratin potatoes I&apos;ve had at a local steakhouse - one of my favorite splurges there. Thanks for sharing Celeste!"
5,The taste of these potatoes is wonderful. The one thing I would do differently next time is to simmer in water for about 4 to 5 minutes. I did 8 and it was too long. Excellent flavor I will make again for sure.
5,"Celeste...these potatoes are so yummy! Quick to put together and so creamy, my family loved this dish. I nearly broke the bank on the Gruyere but it was so worth it!"
2,These weren&apos;t awful.  I just felt they were a little bland and not worth the cost of the cheese you put in.
5,"I loved this recipe, very similar to mine. I dry age my beef for a week prior to the dinner. I let my roast sit out @ room temp for  2 1/2 to 4 hours before cooking. I like a higher heat,  I preheat the oven to 500 degrees.
                                
                                 Put the room temperature roast in the preheated oven (@500 degrees) and roast 15 minutes for EACH rib. Six rib roast = 1.5 hours @ 500 degrees.
                                
                                When cooking time is finished, turn off the oven. ""Do not open the door at any time"". 
                                Allow the roast to remain in the oven until oven is lukewarm, (about two hours). 
                                The roast will still have a crunchy brown crust and will be cooked to a perfect medium rare."
5,"I did like another reviewer...  I let my roast sit out @ room temp for 2-1/2 to 4 hours before cooking. I PREHEAT the OVEN to 500*F. Put the room temperature roast in the preheated oven (@500*F) & roast 15 minutes for EACH rib. Six rib roast = 1.5 hours @ 500 degrees. When cooking time is finished, turn off the oven. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN DOOR! Allow the roast to remain in the oven until oven is lukewarm, (@2 hours). The roast will still have a crunchy brown crust & will be cooked to a perfect medium rare."
5,The best prime rib I ever made. This recipe was easy to follow and the prime rib was outstanding. I will make this my go to way of making prime rib. Give it a try!
5,I tried this recipe with a 9 pound bone in rib roast and  wow it was amazing..... The cook time was a little off because at 2 hours it was at  135 internal temp and really it should have been pulled out at about 120 so it would of ended up about 130 to 135. Very tasty.
5,"I made this today and thought to myself...kind of crazy for me to try a new recipe on Christmas day.....but took a shot at it.   I bought a 5.30 pound prime rib roast at Costco.  $16.89 a pound....worth every penny. It was literally a ""Prime"" beef -- top shelf for Costco standard.   Recipe is very easy to follow.  I didnt have any garlic powder and just added a little minced garlic in its place.  Everyone loved dinner.  It was as good as any 5 star restaurant.   Amazing taste!   I couldn&apos;t be happier."
5,"This Prime Rib was &apos;&apos;FANTASTIC&apos;&apos;....Served this on Christmas Eve.. I had a 4# Roast, rubbed the &apos;&apos;crust&apos;&apos; on well.... Cooked it at 450 degrees for 30 min., then 325 degrees for another 90 min., let it sit for 45 min before slicing... it was &apos;&apos;Med-Rare&apos;&apos; and my dinner guests loved it...This is a &apos;&apos;KEEPER&apos;&apos;... Will use it from now on!!"
5,Never having turkey again after this roast. The flavourings had me thinking about the best smoked meat. Meat melted in your mouth.
5,Wonderful for special occasions or anytime!
5,I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I cooked a 14 lb prime rib and baked it 3 hours. I turned it down to 325 instead of 350  degrees after the initial 30 minutes at 450 degrees. My family loved it!
3,"This was my first time to make this roast.  I had high hopes, as I love all the ingredients involved.  I prepared and cooked it EXACTLY as written/shown.  (Nothing frustrates me more than a review that is 50% edited from another recipe.)  That said, prepared as described, flavor is 6/10 finished product is 5/10.  Previous reviewers who mentioned cooking it at 500 for first 30 mins, then 325 for remaining minutes are exactly correct.  I went by the directions and pulled out my roast when thermometer read 55*C (rare, according to recipe.)  The roast was medium-medium well.  There is a chance my thermometer is wrong, but not my reading of it.  Might use the rub part again, never the roasting instructions.  Good meat gone...meh."
5,"Great Great recipe with some tweaking.... Here&apos;s what I did for perfect results.  I added two more tablespoons to the butter it called for, and put half of the salt, half of the almond extract and a tad bit more of the vanilla... Perfecto... They are soft, creamy, melt in your mouth......"
5,"YUMMY!  AND FINALLY I&apos;ve found a Spritz cookie recipe I will keep FOREVER!!  :)   I did modify the recipe, though, by using only 1/4t almond flavoring and 1/4 t vanilla flavoring.  There was no bitter after-taste, only the melt-in-your-mouth taste of buttery spritz.  The confectioner&apos;s sugar also makes this cookie very smooth.  GREAT recipe!  It&apos;s a definate keeper!"
3,"I agree with KARLA13, the preparation is easy but the cookie after-taste isn&apos;t that appealing. Although they looked nice, I couldn&apos;t give them out because of the after-taste. I make spriz cookies a lot and this taste was like no other..."
4,I made this recipe with three other Spritz recipes from this site. The texture was perfect for press cookies but I found the almond flavoring overwhelming both in the dough and in teh finished product. I took them to work and to a church social and asked folks to rate them. These were the least favorite of the four Spritz recipes. I&apos;m thinking maybe I should try them without the almond.
5,I have to share this with you. I have my grandmother&apos;s press which is at least 50 years old. I have NEVER been able to get a dough to go thru it without a hassle - until now! This is the most wonderful dough to work with. I did use all vanilla and no almond but stuck with the other measurements (I always use unsalted butter so I didn&apos;t play with the salt at all). It was a breeze - no chilling the dough. Couple of hints though - be sure to let the cookie sheets cool completely so that your dough grabs it (I even put my outside on the deck to chill them). Also I found that I got WAY more than 3 dozen out of a batch - I used the wreath and camel and tree patterns and a double recipe gave me more than 12 dozen cookies (I gave up counting at that point:). Finally I always find spritz taste better the next day (like pizelles they need that overnight rest to really let the vanilla shine thru). Good luck and definitely try this one!
4,These turned out very tasty. However the dough was too firm to go through my cookie press. After adding a little more butter the consistency was right and the cookies turned out well.
4,"it was easy and I concur with the other reviews ""what aftertaste??"" I did customize this recipe to make 6 1/2 dozen and needed to add 1/4 more butter to work the cookie press. Overall a great recipe for the cookie press."
5,This is an excellent spritz cookie recipe. Followed the recipe exactly as written and had excellent results. This is a keeper.
5,I tried this recipe because of the reviews. I have never had any luck making press cookies but using this recipe was a breeze! Really has a good taste and very easy to use in the press. I give it five stars!
3,"These are quite heavy and very egg-y compared with my English Nana’s recipe which calls for 1/2 cup each water and milk and 2 eggs. And we always use butter. Using fat was something she thought poor people used because they couldn’t afford butter and it just wasn’t proper, lol. When I make them with Nan’s recipe, they come out already in the shape of cups. There’s no poking needed, and it’s light and crispy yet still very soft. These are ok, though."
5,Perfect just they way my dad form London made them......nice tip with  putting in an air vent at the end
5,The only change i made was that i HALVED the recipe tthey turned out beautifully! I used the leftover prime rib roast from Chef John as well!
5,It was awesome. I read somewhere if you don&apos;t have beef fat that you can use butter instead.....but I haven&apos;t tried it yet.
4,Followed recipe exactly. Impressed with the results. I&apos;m teaching my cook to make popovers and this recipe is the one I&apos;ll be using . Although I think I&apos;ll cut the time by 5 mins.
5,"I&apos;ve made them twice, and they came out perfect both times."
3,These ended up turning out well despite the mess. I used oil since my roast didn&apos;t produce enough fat. I questioned the amonnt of oil needed in each muffin cup (used a pan for large muffins)...should have trusted my instincts because a tablespoon of oil was WAY too much and made a huge smokey mess in the oven. I think 1 teaspoon of oil would be plenty since there was 1/4 inch of oil left in each tin and 1/4 inch had bubbled out to the bottom of my oven.
5,It wasGreat
5,"I thought this was great... I use cider exclusively in place of water, but I do that with everything like this. This is very rich and creamy... definitely the best I&apos;ve tried!
                                
                                P.S. If you change everything in the recipe (amounts, ingredients, cooking time) and then ultimately you don&apos;t like the end result, don&apos;t come back and rate the recipe a ""three"". Don&apos;t rate the recipe at ALL unless you FOLLOW it; that&apos;s just not fair."
5,Wonderful! Used Captain Morgan&apos;s spiced rum topped with French Vanilla Cool Whip and sprinkled nutmeg on top. An addicting dessert in a mug.
5,Oh so yummy. I cut the recipe in half thinking it seemed like alot. Wrong move. Make the whole recipe. Add double batter rum and spices. Added whipped cream sprinked w/ cinnamon. Used Captain Morgans spiced rum. My friends loved it!!!
5,My mom uses this same recipe. When we were young we got to have it in coffee as a treat. She gave me a tub of it and my roommate ate it all with a spoon like ice cream! Good stuff!
5,Made this batter Christmas Eve and just finished the batter tonight end of March! An excellent recipe but you may want to cut it in half. I gave batter away to two different friends and still had tons left over. It is so darn good we even warmed it in the microwave and poured it over vanilla ice cream as a sauce yummy!
5,Simply delicious! I put 2 tbsp of batter as others have suggested with 1-2 oz spiced rum topped with cool whip. It was a hit on Christmas day and will definetly make it again :)
4,This was the first time I have ever had anything like this so I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. It was good. Not the kind of drink I drink all night its very rich but what a treat!
5,Sooooo delicious. The hit of Christmas Eve. Thanks Sheri
5,Can&apos;t wait to try this!!!!
2,So disappointing. I followed the instructions to the letter but it just doesn&apos;t taste that great. It&apos;s too sweet and not buttery enough for my liking. If I were to make this again I&apos;d cut the confectioner&apos;s sugar completely. Overall it&apos;s just not that good for the calories you&apos;re consuming while drinking it.
5,Try it in your bread machine. Really! Just put in all the liquid ingredients then the flour (I reduced the amount to 2 1/4 cups) and then the yeast on top...after it has started to mix together add the candied fruit a little at a time. Most of it will mix in some may be left at the bottom of the pan. After the first rise remove it from the machine. Turn your oven on to 200 degrees for 5 minutes - then turn it off. Knead the dough a little to get all the fruit in - the dough should be soft and a little sticky - don&apos;t add to much flour it will make the final product stiff and dry! Then roll it out and put in the marzipan just like the recipe says. Put it in the warmed oven to rise - I guarantee it will rise up beautifully - as long as you haven&apos;t added too much flour! It is a wonderful recipe!
5,This is the 4th year I&apos;ve used this recipe to make stollen as gifts for family and friends. It&apos;s great! A few tips for people first setting out: 1) Marzipan contains almonds so take care if you or anyone you make it for has nut allergies. 2) This makes a HUGE stollen. When the recipe calls for folding the halves it over onto one another instead put each half on its own tray (or well separated on a large baking pan) and make two in one go. 3) Sprinkle icing sugar on the stollen just after you pull them out of the oven - don&apos;t wait! The heat from the dough will be sufficient to melt the sugar and create a sugary &apos;crust&apos; instead of just powder.
5,I have tried several Stollen recipes and this one is the best. The traditional German bread was moist inside with a delightfully sweet marzipan surprise. Thanks!
4,My parents are German immigrants and I make Christstollen every year and sell it on ebay. This is very close to the recipe I have developed from authentic sources. I use orange peel lemon peel and citron and I don&apos;t use candied cherries. Christstollen is baked throughout the Christmas season in Germany and it is tradition in some parts of the country to eat the last one on Easter - and that was before modern refrigeration (no freezers)! The way this was accomplished is in how the loaf is finished. While the loaf is still warm you brush it with copious amounts of melted butter. I would recommend 1/4 cup butter for this one loaf. It is then THICKLY coated with powdered sugar. This process keeps all the moisture inside the loaf as well as adding wonderful flavor. The reason for the shape of the Stollen loaf is that is to represent the Christchild in swaddling clothes. I shape the loaf by first spreading the dough into an oval shape about 6 inches by 14 inches. If I am using marzipan as in this recipe I lay the log near one edge then roll that long edge over the marzipan gathering the sides in slightly then rolling to about 1 inch away from the other side pressing gently. Stollen is a wonderful accompaniment to coffee or tea and it wouldn&apos;t be Christmas in our house without it! Merry Christmas!
4,"My hubby&apos;s family is German and it isn&apos;t Christmas without a stollen. Usually we order one from Dresden but last year I decided to make one. I&apos;m giving it four stars because it passed the in law test and was delicious but MAN is it a lot of work. If you&apos;re willing to put in the time to find the ingredients and make it, this IS the recipe you want to try. We&apos;re buying a stollen this year, simply because I&apos;m being lazy. This recipe is authentic and wonderful. Oma and Opa would approve!"
5,WOW this was awesome. I have had Stollen for all my life and never made it. I used this recipe and because I am a chef was able to assertain the process from experience of making yeast leavened breads. It turned out excellent my girlfriend could not stop eating it. I think this should be part of anyone&apos;s holiday treat.
1,I ended up with a big wet gloppy mess. I threw out the dough without baking.
5,This was great - not only good to eat but pretty. I used fast action yeast instead of regular dried yeast and the recipe worked fine. I stirred the fast action yeast into the dry ingredients then added the warmed milk and egg. Normally fast action yeast takes less time to double and requires one raising time. With all the fruit in this the dough took a good hour and a quarter to double. Then I shaped it left it for about ten minutes and put it in the oven. I thought the dough was easy to handle.
5,My mother used to make this for us every Christmas morning a treat that our family eagerly anticapated each year. It&apos;s delicous fruity but not overly so sweet and chewy and if you use green food coloring in the icing very festive looking. Though I no longer live at home I still take the time to make this treat for my own family. It&apos;s worth the prep time for sure!
5,My rating is just for the topping not the actual cupcake. So adorable!
5,They are adorable! Got lots of compliments at Christmas parties! Take a while so plan for that when making.
5,The Reindeer Cupcakes were a big hit with our family and neighbors. I did not use red jelly beans (too big). Jellybeans are not always available anyway; instead I used Imperials (red cinnamon candies) found in the baking section of many stores.
5,Didn&apos;t change a thing. This was a trial run but I&apos;ll definitely be making them for Christmas for my grand babies. They loved them!
5,soooo good.. made for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I used roasted pecans pom red onion and feta cheese. I made a dressing ( balsamic with honey salt and pepper...mixed well then add a bit of olive oil ) and it was great with it! Plus be sure you dont drain the pom seeds and add the juice on top of the salad! Yummy!!
5,I made this for Christmas last year and it was beautiful. It&apos;s easy to remove the pomigranate seeds if you place it in a dish of water and remove the seeds underwater. This prevents them from popping out on the counter and floor. The red and green presentation of this salad is very elegant.
5,Love this salad; make it for a Christmas gathering every year and get rave reviews. Good and good for you!!
5,I toast the walnuts first. The best dressing for this is if you can find pomegranate molasses and whisk in some EVOO little sugar and a dash of S & P. You can also buy pomegranate seeds already cleaned and ready at Trader Joes!
5,A great combination of ingredients! My store was out of my favorite spinach so I used a spring mix instead. I also skipped the sprouts. I used the Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe from this site and it was a superb salad! One suggestion would be to toast the walnuts.
5,Easy pretty to look at and delicious! I loved the crunchy texture the walnuts and pomegranate seeds added. Next time I think I would divide all the toppings into two halves so that I could toss a bit of it all together and then top artfully with the rest. This recipe&apos;s a keeper!
5,Love this recipe! Most recently I was unable to find pomegranates out-of-season so I had to do a last-minute substitution of mandarin oranges. Was delicious and colorful too!
5,excellent salad.I added cottage cheese as feta cheese is not available here.In place of vinegar I used lemon juice and salt. Chhaya
5,"this was a hit in our house!! i think you could serve it with or without the feta but i&apos;m not a big fan of feta cheese. i served my salad with a homemade vinaigrette which i based off of ""balsamic vinaigrette"" on this site. Mix together the following ingredients and let sit for a little while to allow flavors to work together: 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar 1 clove crushed garlic 1 tsp ground mustard 1 pinch salt black pepper to taste and 3 TB honey"
3,I took this to a dinner with my girlfriends and it was not a hit. The pomegranate seeds did get some attention though. It&apos;d make a nice salad around Christmas time given the red green and white colors.
5,"I’ve used this recipe for the last several years for our traditional New Year’s Day panettone French toast.  It’s perfect.  But we cook way more than one slice at a time!  For 1/2 of a large panettone, I quadrupled the recipe (1 cup milk, 4 eggs, and a generous shake or two of cinnamon).  I used an electric griddle and found that 300 degrees worked well.  (375 degrees made it too brown/burned while the middle was still soggy.)"
5,Yummy! I like to melt the butter in the syrup and pour over toast keeping it nice and warm.
5,Perfect!!
5,Simple and very very good. A great use for all that Christmas Panettone.
5,Yummy. Thanks
5,Very easy and delicious! Will make again for sure.
5,Hubs and I both enjoyed these a lot! The pimiento is a nice addition but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to add the peanuts which just didn&apos;t sound appealing. Rather than steaming the beans I nuked them while I had the butter/soy mixture on the stove. I didn&apos;t bother refrigerating it overnight and I don&apos;t see how doing that would have necessarily been an improvement. Very pretty and nicely flavored.
1,"Too much garlic soy sauce is overpowering and the peanuts were the worst thing of all. We tried this recipe because it sounded interesting however out of a whole family of ""we&apos;ll try anything"" eaters-NOBODY liked this absolutely nobody. Sorry!"
5,I used fewer pimentos and about 1/2 the amount of soy sauce and raw peanuts to cut down on the salt content and they were still delicious
5,The family LOVED this recipe. I used pine nuts instead of peanuts (because my husband ate the peanuts the night before!). It was pretty tasty and perfect on the seasoning. Great small of garlic too. Excellent recipe thanks!!
4,Simple and pretty colors for the holiday table. This was a hit for the whole family. Just wish there was a way to make the sauce stick to the beans.
4,The flavor of these over all was really very good. I cut the butter lemon & soy in half and still used more than 2 lbs of green beans. Even cutting the sauce in half it was still too much sauce for us. I didn&apos;t have pimentos so I used red bell pepper diced small. Hubby LOVED the addition of peanuts. I have some left over sauce and will try it on broccoli tomorrow. Thanks for an inspiring recipe.
5,This recipe is excellent. I used just 1/2 a cup of chopped peanuts and it was more than enough. Everyone raved over this dish and asked for the recipe.
5,Got raves at the Thanksgiving dinner with this recipe and requests to make it again at Christmas.
5,Simple and great tasting! My husband hates pimentos but asked for seconds of this recipe! I didn&apos;t use soy sauce or salt and added walnuts. I steamed the veggies in the microwave and then heated the mixture in the microwave so it was extremely simple to combine and eat. Yummy will definitely make again!
5,"Wonderful easy recipe for the holidays! To ensure the sugar crusted on the rim I made these the evening before with red and white sugar crystal&apos;s and let them ""sit up""! Preparing ahead of time allowed the sugar to last through more than one refill of champagne! Beautiful festive fun and turned an ordinary glass of champagne into a work of art. Guests definitely felt special when sipping these!"
5,This is insane good. I could drink these all night. Even my husband the whiskey drinker liked this. YUM.
5,I gave my sister in law the task of making the Christmas brunch cocktail and she came in with this little gem! Oh my it was so good that 3 of us drank the whole pitcher ourselves. Oh and don&apos;t skip the sugar rimmed glass it gave it the right festive touch.
5,OH HOLY COW!!! These were outstanding!! I served these New Years eve and they blew the 50.00 bottle of Gruet Champagne out of the water! I used Patron Citronage and Turbinado sugar! There were requests for these for brunch!! Alas I was out of champagne... will definitely make again! This recipe is a keeper!!
5,A great drink to celebrate Mother&apos;s Day (or any occasion for that matter!). These are easy to prepare and a tasty twist on traditional mimosas. A definite make again.
5,i have been looking for this drink and no one knew how to make it. i will try this drink out this weekend thank you for the recipe. i find out alot of good menues on all recipes this is the best web site to go to
5,Easy and delicious! I loved the rim with sugar it looked special! Will make again.
5,This has been our regular mimosa recipe I&apos;ve used for years.....nothing is better than this composition in my opinion!
5,Made this recipe for our Christmas brunch. We have a big family so I recalculated the recipe for 36 servings and made it in my 3-gallon drink dispenser. I rimmed the glasses with red and green sanding sugar (like you use for Christmas cookies) and put one marachino cherry in the bottom of each glass before serving. It was delicious! Be careful with it since it goes down so easily! Thanks for the great recipe!
5,"Instead of sauteing the onion in vegetable oil, I used butter. The recipe didn&apos;t specify which kind of onion I should use, I used four large green onions. I threw in a clove of fresh minced garlic in with the onion when I sauteed it. I used a homemade dry ranch dressing mix, increased the bacon bits a bit and added a touch of Frank&apos;s Hot Sauce. The boys LOVED these deviled eggs--they ate every single one."
5,SOOOOO GOOD! I liked the cooked onion in this though I didn&apos;t see in the directions about adding it in w/ the other ingredients but I assume that you were supposed to so I did lol. Great flavor...will be making these again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)
5,2 thumbs up! I had never made deviled eggs before and didn&apos;t want to start out with just a basic mayo and mustard recipe so decided to give this a try. It&apos;s amazing! I cut the recipe down to 8 servings because I wanted to try it first and it&apos;s definitely a keeper. I didn&apos;t add any cheese because my husband doesn&apos;t care for it but everything else was to the T.
5,"These are just amazing. I was concerned about the onions so made less than a dozen eggs but will be doing the rest of them shortly. These are ""slap yo&apos; momma"" good!!!"
5,We loved these eggs. The sauteed onions was a amazing twist to these and everything just blended so well with these deviled eggs. Love the flavors.
5,These are delicious!! I omit the onions and bake my eggs in a muffin tin at 325 degrees for 30 minutes (turn after 15 mins to avoid harmless brown spots) rather than boiling in water on the stove. It is easy and still yummy! Thanks for the recipe!
5,My husband doesn&apos;t like Deviled Eggs but loved these! I was taking them to a Super Bowl Party and he said he was going to tell everyone they were Alligator eggs and was horrible. That way he could eat more. Was out of fresh onion so I used some dehydrated onions. Just soaked them in some water. Squeezed out the moisture and add them to the mixture. Worked fine. Thanks for sharing!
5,My family and guests all loved these. I will definitely make again.
5,YUM. This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I omitted the onions for taste but kept the onion power. Wonderful!
2,I made these exactly as written and did not care the end result. I thought they were too rich and the taste was off. There clearly are people out there who like this combination of ingredients but to me i was looking for that perfect bite where creamy was balanced by tanginess. When you bite into these you taste lots of cheese onions and bacon followed by a taste of the creamy but forgettable yolk mixture. It actually made me feel nauseous. For me i will stick to classic deviled eggs in the future.
5,"I am the recipe submitter and I just wanted to add a side note since there has been a few questions on how to keep the banana slices from browning. Use fruit juice there are several fruit juices that can work to prevent discoloration of sliced bananas. If you&apos;re worried about the flavor changing, stick to the sweeter, lighter flavors:
                                Lemon juice
                                Orange juice
                                Tinned pineapple juice
                                Tinned or fresh grapefruit juice
                                Lime juice
                                Apple juice
                                Ascorbic acid powder(aka vitamin C) or if you&apos;re in a pinch, a ground-up vitamin C tablet works as well."
4,"Another twist on this that I have seen is to use green olive, grape tomato, and white cheese."
5,Fun to take to a pitch in.  Easy and so cute!
5,"Instead of toothpicks, I made these on top of wooden meat skewers and arranged them in a holiday vase for a party. They were a hit!"
5,I made these for Christmas Eve. They are easy to make and the kids can help. Everyone thought they were a cute little treat. I am glad I read the review about dipping the banana slice in orange juice as well as the longer wooden kabob sticks and placed them in large wine glass
5,this was a hit at my open house. I borrowed Monica&apos;s idea put them on meat skewers and arranged in a 1 pint mason jar. it worked great!
5,Easy & grandkids loved them. Used coffee stirrers from Starbucks. No pointed sticks for little ones. Length perfect.
4,Easy to make changed it up a bit added white cheese for the hat trim and put on a toothpick with a white fuzzy top. Big hit at our pot luck lunch.
5,What fun! Thank you CNM Catering for this cute idea. We used big raspberries instead of strawberries because my grocery was out. It worked perfectly anyway. We used these on swizzle sticks in our cocktails. They were a hit! I think the alcohol in the cocktails helped keep the banana from browning!:-)
3,Cute idea.
5,This is the real deal. It is important to make sure the potatoes are cold before adding the flour and other ingredients and be sure to keep the uncooked lefsa cold before rolling out. I also use bread flour - the lefse turns out much more tender. Lefse can also be frozen too.
4,"This is the closest to my mom&apos;s recipe that I have seen.  One suggestion I would make is if you are not eating it right away (we make 20 lbs. of potatos at a time and freeze it) cool your lefse between two towels, inside a plastic garbage bag.  It will be moist and even the lefse that come off the grill a little crispy and dry will be soft and moist."
5,I have been looking for a lefse recipe for over a year. Well no more this is the one I will use forever. My 81 year old father in-law said it was just like his mother used to make. And I found it very easy to do.
5,"This is an authentic recipe for lefse, very similar to my Norwegen Mother in Law&apos;s.  The flour amount is correct, it is scant because it takes into account that quite a bit of extra flour is needed for rolling out the lefsa.  My MIL&apos;s tip was not to add the flour all at once.  Divide the potato mixture into enough for 10 lefsa per batch and add the proportionate flour to mix in just before you roll the dough.  You won&apos;t have to add as much flour to the rolling surface and will have more tender lefse.  Also..if your potatos are very moist, either dry them in the oven or cut back on the amount of cream you add to the dough.  You don&apos;t want to develop too much of the gluten in the flour which makes the lefsa rubbery or tough.   Lefsa it easiest to bake with two people; one to roll out the lefsa and one to mind the griddle!"
5,This recipe was terrific! I love making lefse and this was one of the best I have tried in fact I have decided that in the future this is the only recipe I will use. I am all Norwegian so it&apos;s in my blood. I also like that Allrecipes makes it possible for me to select the amount of servings. I made this recipe for 45 servings - 90 lefse - that will be enough for all the holidays. Thanks D. Brockman!!!!!!!
5,I made this recipe last year for my family at Christmas. My grandpa was 100% Norwegian. He has passed away but my grandma tried the lefse from this recipe and said it tasted just like the lefse my grandpa&apos;s mother used to make. One thing I found with the recipe is that the amount of butter cream salt sugar and flour is enough for 5 pounds of potatoes (not 10). If you want to do 10 pounds you will need twice the amount of other ingredients. Excellent recipe! Thank you!!!!!
5,"I grew up in a Norwegian family where we ate lefse 3 times a day for the whole Christmas season! My mom & I make lefse every year. We&apos;re always frustrated with our recipe not rolling out properly. This is the best recipe we have used to date! Here are some tips we&apos;ve learned through the years...hope this helps other&apos;s trying to make this yummy treat!!!
                                - The flour amount is perfect!! But use LOTS of flour in a sifter to sprinkle on your pastry board, rolling pin and dough to prevent sticking. That extra flour used for rolling probably doubles the flour amount used. Too much flour makes the lefse rubbery. 
                                - Divide dough up into several logs rolled in wax paper and keep the extra&apos;s in the fridge. Cold dough is easier to work with.
                                - Use a kitchen scale and weigh each hunk of dough before rolling.
                                - Use a cloth cover over your pastry board and rolling pin to prevent dough from sticking.(can be purchased or make your own with unbleached cotton) Keep extra&apos;s on hand to swap if they get too moist (hand wash them...or use mild detergent & no fabric softener)
                                - Have lots of patience, a friend to work with and cushy slippers to stand on! This full recipe with 2 people will take about 6 hrs & yield about 80-100 8"" pieces if rolled 1/16"" thin. (1/8"" is too thick)
                                - Practice! Your first few may not turn out so well. 
                                - BTW...A pizza stone makes a great lefse rolling board!
                                - If you want to make lefse often...invest in a good corrogated rolling pin - it does make a difference!
                                - Enjoy!"
5,Perfect lefse! I&apos;ve been looking for a good lefse recipe for a long time and this one has the most traditional taste and texture. Wonderful!
5,"I am wondering if Saraphine is my cousin? Because that sounds just like my story! Our grandma was a 5th-generation immigrant from Norway who settled in WA she brought this family recipe with her. Interestingly we ate it the same way as you do: Rolled up with butter and sugar! According to Wikipedia this is a variation called tynnlefse or ""thin lefse"" and rolling it up with butter and sugar is called ""lefse-klining"". The lefse griddle I purchased also came with a similar recipe but it called for 4 cups of flour! I believe I ended up splitting the difference and using about 3 cups: When it had the consistency of Play-Dough that was the time to stop adding flour. It does want to stick to EVERYTHING: I found that to get it really thin like Grandma&apos;s you have to spread flour over it GENEROUSLY both on your work surface and on the top which contacts your rolling pin. Which is fine because I remember the lightly floury texture the lefse always had. Thank you so much. The picture looked JUST like my grandma used to make! I&apos;m afraid I cried into my lefse it brought back so many wonderful family memories!"
2,"Um, you need at least 2 more cups of flour for this recipe. My dough turned out wetter than cookies dough. Stuck to my fingers like mad. Tasted good...once I added 2 more cups of flour."
5,"It&apos;s a holiday staple. I use Jameson Irish Whiskey, my favorite. I think the flavor, and certainly the alcohol, loses its kick the more it&apos;s kept warm. I will usually add more at the end.
                                
                                I think one of the kids made it with the brandy once, but I was getting so cranky/flustered with all our 20-somethings in the kitchen that I threw more straight Jameson into my mug. 
                                
                                I believe they call that &apos;self-medicating&apos;. Enjoy!"
5,"Was very tasty but I put the cloves and ginger in a cheesecloth bag and that seemed to help keep it ""neat"" looking."
5,Holiday Cheers....... We really love it! I used clementine(3) Excellent for Christmas Eve......Merry Christmas.
5,I made this wine in the slow cooker for a winter solstice party. Everyone enjoyed it. Several guests asked for the recipe and made it for Christmas. Easy and festive.
4,Nice recipe but it turned out a bit bitter. Next time I will try it with less ginger.
5,This was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I followed the recipe exactly using a very nice and smooth Argentinian merlot. The only difference was that I didn&apos;t have any brandy so I used what I had on hand which was Remy Martin. Not an economical way to go but it was amazing! I also like the idea of trying it with Jameson&apos;s. Anyway I will make this again. It&apos;s wonderful on these very cold nights in front of the fireplace.
5,Did mine on the stovetop and goosed the brandy up to probably 1/2 c (had a bit left in the bottle so I just dumped it in). Perfection on a chilly December night. I&apos;m making this for Xmas eve!
5,Loved it! Perfect on a cold winter night. I didn t have any fresh ginger on hand so I threw in about 1T of crystallized ginger chips. Put slow cooker on high to get it hot quickly. Garnished as pictured. I may make it again tonight!
4,Good but next time I&apos;d use fewer cloves and less ginger.
4,"Wow! For those of you who put in 2 cups of peanuts, you must really like a lot of nuts! 
                                I put in about 1 & 1/4 cups and stopped there. 
                                I didn&apos;t even attempt the fork idea. I kept my cookie sheet warm in the oven while the candy was cooking. When I poured the mixture onto the warm pan, it stayed soft long enough for me to then tilt the pan to spread the candy out."
5,"This recipe turns out great. I&apos;ve made it several times. I use a digital candy thermometer for accuracy. It must reach 300-degrees F. to be crunchy. Baking soda adds an ""easier bite"" to the peanut brittle, causing it to break when less force is applied. It also causes the sugar base around the peanuts to be opaque. It does this by ""foaming up"" and introducing small bubbles in the sugar syrup. If you desire a clearer almost transparent sugar base around the peanuts and a ""harder bite"", reduce or omit the baking soda. If you use roasted peanuts instead of raw, be careful not heat the mixture above 300-degrees F. or the peanuts may taste burned. Roasted peanuts can also be added at the end of cooking to prevent burning.  If you use salted peanuts, omit the salt in the recipe."
5,"Great Brittle. A few tips: Be sure to have butter and baking soda measured out beforehand and waiting, (and butter softened) stir them in well to mix, but dont stir it to death. when it is foamy and pale, stir a few times more, and then stop. I doubled the recipe (a single recipie for a single household, double it to share with anyone) and used a half-sheet size (read: about 17""x13"" with a lip on it about an inch tall. I covered the pan with extra-wide aluminum foil and buttered the  foil, and the sides of the foil. As soon as you are done stirring the stuff in, pour it onto the foil, and spread it out. I did this by picking the pan up and kind a shaking it around. If you try to spread it around like frosting, you&apos;ll end up breaking all those beautiful little bubbles that make it crunchy but light. Have fun!"
5,"This is my first time making candy, and it was awesome!! I added the teaspoon of vanilla as suggested, and almost 2 cups of peanuts. The only thing I would do differently is less peanuts. My sis-in-law liked the extra peanuts. So of course, I think it depends on what you like more, the candy or the peanuts. Very easy. By the way, have a pot of BOILING water that you can place your utensils in immediately to help with clean up."
5,"Fabulous!  This stuff tastes just wonderful, and was very easy to make with very little cleanup afterwards.  Since I live in a country where corn syrup is not available, I had to substitute light molasses for the corn syrup, which worked just fine.  
                                
                                A couple of suggestions--even though the amount of liquid is originally not very large, be sure you use a large pot since the extremely hot, sticky mixture foams up to many time its original size when the butter and baking soda are added.  Also, don&apos;t dump out the mixture onto the cookie sheet in just one place and expect you&apos;ll be able to spread the peanuts around evenly afterwards--you&apos;ll crush all the bubbles.  A better tactic would be to pour the mixture out onto the cookie sheet in a circular pattern so the peanuts are evenly distributed to begin with, then tilt the pan to get the liquid spread evenly."
5,"I&apos;d give this ten stars if I could!  I made many batches of this and gave out for Christmas gifts and received RAVE reviews.  You definitely have to have the ingredients ready to go while you are making this, but don&apos;t let that scare you off.  Once you have done one or two batches, you definitely get a ""feel"" for the process.  Here are a couple of notes that might help.  First, USE A CANDY THERMOMETER.  I can&apos;t imagine being successful without this.  While stirring, the candy takes quite a little time to get to the desired temperature, and CONSTANT stirring is not necessary.  But WATCH OUT...once it gets to around 250 degrees it RAPIDLY shoots up to the 300 degree temperature and you need to be right on top of it.  I learned to let it stay at the 300 degree point for a bit to brown the candy and the peanuts.  It gave it a GREAT flavor, but BE CAREFUL!!!  Also, I added from one and a half to two cups of peanuts, and liked the consistency.  This mlay well be an annual tradition!"
5,"This is the recipe my family has used for 30 years and always gets rave reviews.  Certainly a candy thermometer would be helpful but we&apos;ve never used one.  I was taught to cook the syrup until the stir spoon held about two feet above the pot has a long thin thread going down to the pot - then stir in the peanuts and cook until the peanuts are tan.  Mix in the rest in one quick motion and spread on WARM cookie sheets to help it spread. 
                                Yummm."
5,"LOVED IT! I took some of the advice from other reviewers and waited to add the peanuts at 250 deg.(Not one scortched peanut!), cooked it to 305 deg. and added 1 tsp vanilla. It was so easy! I also couldn&apos;t wait to try it so I popped it in the frezzer for about 20 min. until it cooled off."
5,"This peanut brittle is delicious! It is fairly simple to make, even for a novice candy maker. I  did change a few things as per other peoples suggestions. I added 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar (which gave it a nice colour and taste) and I had dry roasted peanuts so I waited until my thermometer read 250 to add them. I added 1 tsp of vanilla when I added the butter and baking soda. Everyone was right, you do have to wait a while for it to get up to 250 but once it hits that it goes really fast. And you have to work fast at spreading it on the pan. I had my pan in the oven before hand as well to help. And to make it go even faster I put the pan outside in the cold air and it cooled in no time! I will definitly be making this again!"
1,I followed directions exactly and the peanut brittle never hardened.
5,"This recipe was great! I prepared it a day in advance and wrapped it in the puff pasty the night I cooked the dish which made it very easy when meat was cooled. I did add a few extra minutes to the bake time because the meat had been refrigerated overnight but it turned out perfectly! My parents and boyfriend loved this dish. Will have to make again for sure! I appreciate the recipe and video, they were comprehensive and easy to follow!"
5,"Please don&apos;t let the 2 or 3 pages of instructions throw you.  This is my go-to New Years Eves easy-peasy dish.  When I first began making this dish frozen puff pastry wasn&apos;t invented yet!  Believe me the pastry available today has made this a cinch.  Just buy the best tenderloin filets you can find (and afford).  The mushroom ""Pate"" is super easy and can even be made the day before."
5,"I would never have had the courage to attempt a beef wellington had it not been for chef John. This was actually a lot simpler than I anticipated.  Follow the directions exactly and it&apos;ll be a hit. I cooked mine for a rare/medium rare to his time specification and it was perfect.  The mushroom and pate mixture was incredible! 
                                I wonder if laying a layer of pastry on the top and one on the bottom,  then trimming and binding them on the sides would work so that you&apos;re not having to stretch the pastry at all would work? I have no idea. Either way, mine turned out perfectly. And I enjoyed having the extra puff pastry on the bottom."
5,"After making the dough instead of using a cookie press or dropping by balls, I rolled the dough into four logs, wrapped the logs in waxed paper, placed in the fridge to harden, and then sliced in about 1/2"" slices. Perfect and delicious. Sometimes I make the dough up to 3 days ahead of time then slice and bake when I need them. After baked I sprinkle with powder sugar. Makes a beauiful presentation."
5,"Excellent shortbread ccokies!! But be prepared when making these, the recipe says it makes 2 dozen and that&apos;s WAY off unless you&apos;re using some super **huge** cookie press! I get at least 6 dozen cookies out of one batch every time I make them!"
5,"these cookies were fantastic!! i rolled out the dough and used cutters.. turned out fantastic.. also have sprinkled with sugar, and others i drizzled with chocolate.. great recipe, you gotta try it.."
5,"This recipe was very easy and came out very good.  But I think the proportions are wrong, I halved the recipe and still made at least 2 dozen.  I also didn&apos;t have a cookie press, so I just rolled the dough into little balls, then flattened them on the cookie sheet.  Next time I plan on dipping them in melted chocolate... mmmm.."
5,Wonderful shortbread cookie! These were so easy to make and yet turned out fabulous. It&apos;s great when such simple ingredients come together to create something so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and let the dough chill in the fridge for a half hour before rolling it out and using cookie cutters vs. a cookie press. I baked the cookies on parchment paper and they were perfectly done in ten minutes. These have a wonderful butter flavor and are great for decorating. When I was all done I placed them in clear cellophane bags tied with ribbon - too cute!
5,"I made a second batch using ""orange"" extract instead of the vanilla.  They were fabulous!"
3,I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I don&apos;t have is a cookie press. I&apos;m a very experienced baker and never had cookie dough go this wrong on me! I chilled the dough for 30 minutes before trying to roll it out but it was still very gooey and sticky. It also tore far too easily and my floured rolling pin couldn&apos;t even go one stretch before tearing it apart and getting the dough stuck to the *floured* surface.   I&apos;m sure this is a great recipe if you have a cookie press. The doug tastes delicious. I ended up pressing it out with my hands and using cutters. This obviously gives sort of ugly uneven cookies but with the amount of butter I used i didn&apos;t want it to go to waste. We&apos;ll see how they bake!  Just a warning to other cookie press-less bakers. I was hugely disappointed. It&apos;s also kind of screwed up my Christmas party as I now only have 3 hours to finish off and offer ugly cookies! Haha.
4,"This is the first time I&apos;ve actually bothered to log in and write a review. Oh man, these cookies are good. Yes, you should add a little confectioner&apos;s sugar to improve the taste and add to the ""melt in your mouth"" factor, as well as some brown sugar for moisture (I added 1/8 of each, 1/4 total). I also cut down on the flour. Thanks to the other reviewers, those few tweaks resulted in a blissful butter-sugar shortbread like cookie that can stand on its own. Normally my favorite cookies have chocolate involved, but honestly, these are so delicious I don&apos;t even miss it. (Hint - because this recipe is so simple, the quality of ingredients has to be good or it will ruin the flavor. I&apos;d bet the majority of people who had issues with this recipe didn&apos;t use unsalted real butter, sifted flour, or real vanilla extract). Seriously, if you&apos;re having a cookie craving, give these a try. YUM!!"
4,"They really do melt in your mouth.  I was surprised that so few ingredients made such a tasty little cookie. This was my first try with a cookie press and this recipe worked wonderfully, even though the directions that came with the press said to use only their recipe."
5,I took a chance and tried this for Thanksgiving a gigantic leap for somebody like me who grew up with butter-only glaze. But I was so wonderfully rewarded with the most perfect turkey I ve ever made. It s sweet but not too sweet and it really melts in your mouth. And it beautifully roasts your turkey to a Hollywood Thanksgiving Turkey golden color that almost makes you feel guilty eating it. The gravy Oh so tasty. It goes great on the turkey great on mashed potatoes great sopped up with biscuits pretty much a wonderful compliment to all of your Thanksgiving sides. And this makes the most unbelievable stock. Team this turkey with mixed bread sage sausage stuffing (find the sage sausage by Jimmy Dean) a shot of white wine and you ll amaze your family with the fantastic meal you ve put together. Here are some basic tips for Thanksgiving turkey though It seems that not everybody on this board has been introduced to the wonder that is Oven Bags. I promise you this recipe in an Oven Roaster Bag and you ll think you ve died and gone to heaven. It browns your turkey perfectly and is much easier than foil. Cut up 2 onions and throw them in the bag sprinkle about a tablespoon of flour in the bag and shake until the onions are well coated Put in the turkey and this sauce. Cut some slits in the bag throw it in the oven and every 30 40 minutes stick a baster in one of the slits and coat the turkey. Voila!
5,I agree with an earlier review... I&apos;ve made this the past 4 years to rave reviews. It was the first turkey recipe I tried as a newlywed and now my mother and grandmother request little old me to make the turkey at the holidays. What an honor and all thanks to this amazing recipe! I too serve with the Sausage Apple & Cranberry stuffing and it&apos;s a perfect match. I also serve with smashed yams with orange juice Cranberry Sauce Extrordinaire (also from this site) and creamy mashed potatoes... it&apos;s a perfect meal! We love Roasted Butternut Squash soup with rolls and salad the night before. It&apos;s filling but leaves plenty of room for the Big Day&apos;s Menu! Thanks Ibby!! (if you&apos;re a new cook I highly recommend trying this it&apos;s simple to follow and always turns out)
5,I&apos;ve made this recipe the past two Thanksgivings and plan to use it again this year. The turkey always comes out moist and the gravy has amazing flavor! The only thing I do differently is add a lot more chicken stock at the bottom of the roasting pan (a lot of it evaporates during cooking).
5,Great recipe! However I like to play around with things and found that a couple minor changes resulted in the best turkey I have ever eaten (my family agrees). The sweetness was a welcome change and especially great since my son and my husband both have a huge sweet tooth. I did add some brown sugar to the maple-butter glaze. Also I had a large turkey injector left from thanksgiving and made my own injector butter mixture. I melted two sticks of butter added 1/2C apple cider 1/4C maple syrup and 1/4C brown sugar. heated over low-med heat until butter was melted and sugar was dissolved then injected all of the mixture into the turkey. Oh man it was good! Oh and for easy suffing just buy the boxed stuff and chop up a sweet apple (i use gala) and thaw some frozen cranberries. Add the fruit to the stuffing when you prepare it then stuff it all into the bird. So good and very easy.
5,I&apos;m updating my review after several years because I could not have Thanksgiving without this recipe. The turkey comes out wonderfully every time and the gravy it makes has become the stuff of legend in my family. The flavor of the turkey is such a hit with friends and family that I have been asked to bring the turkey to a Thanksgiving celebration at someone else&apos;s house! ------------ This didn&apos;t make for the juciest turkey but the bird came out looking like it was right out of a magazine and smelling fabulous. The gravy I made from the pan juices was literally the best I have ever had EVER! And everyone else said so too. Next time I would brine my bird before hand to make it juicy because that&apos;s all it&apos;s lacking.
4,The turkey did come out wonderful. Very moist.I am changing this review to give it 4 stars for the turkey ONLY. The gravy was not a favorite for us. The gravy was very very sweet. I had 2 pkgs of McCormick turkey gravy on hand that I made and added to it and still very sweet. So I added some white wine to it. That did take some of the sweetness away but still left it very sweet. If I do make this turkey recipe again which I probably will. I would not use the drippings for the gravy. I would use store bought or make some ahead of time.
5,"This was a delicious turkey. A nice change from the traditional flavor. I stuffed this with the ""Awesome Sausage Apple and Cranberry Stuffing"" from this site and this made the best Turkey and stuffing I&apos;ve ever eaten. I&apos;ll be making it again."
5,This recipe is going to be standard from now on for Turkey with me. I cooked a Turkey last week (August -- I know but it was good practice and I had an extra bird in my freezer). Had to substitute cider with Simply Apple juice and added a fresh sliced Granny smith for the fruit essence and fished it out of reduction later; lime zest for lemon. It is truly the Maple Syrup that makes this. My butter was a bit wet as I increased the ingredients but no matter. I did not incorporate the veggies but melded the drippings with some stock and the gravy was out of this world. I separated the butter from the drippings and used it to crisp up potatoes. Dried marjoram worked fine. I had fresh Thyme from garden. I cooked bird in dome-covered roasting pan (Oneida)-- basted ONCE! and it came out perfectly tender. Great recipe. Only took 2.5 - 3 hours with 20 pounder.
5,This recipe was tremendous. The turkey turned out juicy and succulent. The only thing I did differently was to stuff a bulb of garlic and some sprigs of rosemary in the turkey cavity before roasting. The gravy was some of the best I&apos;ve ever tasted.
3,The turkey tasted good though the maple flavor didn&apos;t really come through except for in the gravy made later. That was quite sweet so my mom added salt and spices to make the gravy more traditional. I made the maple/butter mixture the night before as well and the next day it was all separated. The butter floated to the top and became hard again in the refridgerator while the maple apple juice and spices remained liquids underneath the butter. I had to break it apart mix it as well as I could and stuff the hard maple butter brickle under the skin. I rubbed the liquid part all around the outside of the turkey. Decent flavor at the end just hard to follow through on.
5,"I am the submitter of this recipe. I need to make clear that this is nothing like a pot pie. It is more like a pork ""meat loaf"" in a double crust. I also want to point out that the magazine published rendition of this recipe has been changed by the editors of Allrecipe magazine and you may notice that this online version (original recipe) ONLY calls for allspice as a seasoning spice. Enjoy!"
5,This was fantastic!!! I am French-Canadian and it is a tradition to serve this on New Year&apos;s Eve where I an from in way upstate NY. Wonderful recipe I made my own crusts and it made the pie that much better. I didn&apos;t really change anything. It was great the way it was written. I have been chasing this recipe for years...and found it in the Dec/Jan 2014-15 issue.
4,We made the magazine version of this. Other than it being to salty for my taste it was really good. My husband said it reminded him of the ones his grandmother used to make. We will try it again with out so much salt.
4,I make this every year around Christmas.I used potato in my pie. I use the instant mashed potato flakes in place of bread crumbs.
5,This looks so much like those that my Memmre used to make us on cold Autumn nights. My mother&apos;s family is French Canadian and I&apos;ve always enjoyed her recipes. This is one of my absolute favorites but now that she&apos;s reaching 70 and it&apos;s just my dad and her living by themselves she rarely makes this anymore. I think my children finally need to be introduced to these old world recipes. I&apos;m going to be making this sometime this weekend.
5,I used a lean pork roast and worstershire sauce and southern seasoning to spice. It was outstanding. After being married to a French Canadian for 36 years this was my first time trying or making a tourtière. Thank you soooo much for the encouragement. The whole family loved it!
5,this is my mom s recipe which is mine now it has been in my family for years as long as I can remember. the only différence my mom would not use onions and would use a pinch of cloves not all spice we love it
5,My mother was not home for a bit and I couldn&apos;t get her to show me again how she makes hers. This one was spot on. I ground my own meat from what we raised and also added a bit of wild game as is our tradition. I forgot the bread crumbs but it turned out just like my mother&apos;s. I thank you for sharing this great recipe.
5,It was fabulous!!!! I made it exactly as the recipe. I added ground beef as well as the pork.
3,"I would like to spare some people the trouble of figuring out why these cookies didn&apos;t come out right.  I read some reviews before I started and some people mentioned that there cookies were hard and the batter was crumbly.  I can tell you why.  MAKE SURE THE BUTTER IS COMPLETELY SOFTENED.  I made 2 batches of cookies for a bake sale.  When I started I thought my butter was soft (and it was).  The mix  became hard and brittle.  The cookies after they cooled were hard. I was disappointed but had to make another batch as I promised.  When I made the second batch the butter had been sitting the whole time and was super soft. The texture of that batter was completely different and those cookies were soft even after they had cooled.  THE TRICK IS THE BUTTER.  Don&apos;t start until it&apos;s like mush.  My son tasted the first batch and said I don&apos;t like them.  I had him taste the second batch and he thought those were good. I used two teaspoons of vanilla instead of one to give it a little more flavor.  Also, you really only need about a teaspoon of batter for each cookie...they really expand while baking.  Another reviewer mentioned that the secret to great sugar cookies is to use margarine which I did.  Hope this helps some of you from making the same mistake I did!  This is a good recipe however I gave it three stars because I realize I don&apos;t really care for sugar cookies..too plain for my taste."
5,"YUM...the easiest and the best-tasting sugar cookie recipe i&apos;ve tried. I like the fact that you don&apos;t have to refrigerate the dough for hours before actually baking. Because of that, you can&apos;t cut them into shapes. But if you&apos;re happy with just round cookies, then this is the recipe for you. ALSO, if you like soft cookies, make sure you take them out in 8 minutes, even though they won&apos;t be a golden brown. Ten minutes and they turn crunchy after they&apos;ve cooled. Make them tonight - they&apos;re SO easy and most everyone should have the ingredients in their pantry."
5,"I know this will sound melodramatic, but I&apos;ve been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe my whole life.  I had accepted the fact that I would never find it when I tried this recipe.  The cookies baked up crispy and buttery, just the right amount of sweetness, chewy for days.  Just writing this review makes me want to go to the kitchen and bake up another batch!  I make cookies for other people every year, and wanted something different for myself, and thought that I&apos;d just give it a try.  I will use this recipe forever and pass it down to my kids... grandkids... you get the picture! :-)"
5,"great cookies! soft and velvety dough, which is especially easy to work with if you chill it for an hour or two before shaping into balls. but be sure to place them apart because they spread a lot. the result is a delicious buttery cookie, crispy on the outside and chewy within. very yummy! i pressed a little chocolate heart into each cookie when they are still hot from the oven, very pretty too. don&apos;t look any further for the perfect sugar cookie!"
5,"I wish I could give these cookies a 10! I absolutely love these and made over 12 dozen over the holidays. I had to make so many because they all disappeared faster than I could bake them. I would strictly follow the 8-minute baking rule with these as long as they&apos;re about the size of a tablespoon. Just be careful not to make them too big. I used a cookie dough scooper making sure it wasn&apos;t overstuffed. They may seem too soft to be done, but when they dry, they&apos;re so chewy and yummy! I also rolled them in sugar before baking. Delicious!!"
5,"Just like the other reviews said, these cookies were perfect! Not too sweet, not too plain. I do suggest adding a little extra vanilla-I thought it needed a deeper flavor. For kids, they were perfect with icing. Don&apos;t cook them too long!  If it seems they need another 2 min.,go ahead and take them out. They will firm up once out of the oven. I WILL be making this again!"
5,OH MY GOSH!! This is WONDERFUL a recipe!!! I tried it because I saw the review from a lady who had been seaching for the perfect sugar cookie recipe because I have been too. AND THIS IS IT!! I just made a batch and it was soooooo easy and good I can&apos;t believe it! I scooped them out with a little cookie scoop I have dipped them in green and red colored sugar and presto--instant Christmas cookies for my get together tonight! I love it! Thank you Stephanie thank you thank you!
4,We used this recipe to make a huge pan cookie to layer it with fruit and a cream cheese frosting to make a cookie pastry. Everyone kept commenting that this was much better than other suger cookie recipes we have used in the past. The pastry was completely devoured in a few minutes. It was nice and soft with just enough crunch to hold it together. Yum Yum!
4,The name of this recipe says it all...it&apos;s so easy and VERY good! After making another sugar cookie recipe (which turned out disasterous) I decided to try this one. I was even able to make shapes out of these! They turned out very tasty and my husband loved them! Thanks!
5,"This is basically our standard green bean casserole recipe with some minor modifications I&apos;ve made over the years.  It&apos;s ALWAYS the first to disappear at potlucks when there are other versions of green bean casseroles and people often ask why it seems to taste so much better than the original one on the French&apos;s can.  I always use French-cut green beans, add a (drained) can of sliced water chestnuts (coarsely chopped) and stir 3 ounces of the French fried onions into the casserole along with ALL of the cheddar cheese.  Heating the ingredients in the microwave is really an unnecessary step.  Bake in a flat casserole dish 30-35 minutes or until hot in the center.  Then sprinkle the other 3 ounces of French fried onions over the top and bake 5 minutes more.  We much prefer the cheese stirred INTO the casserole and NOT put on top.  When doubling the recipe, using one can of water chestnuts works fine since a whole can is almost too much (but we like the crunch!) for a single recipe, depending on personal taste.   If I&apos;m trying to extend the number of servings for a double recipe then I generally use 2 cans of water chestnuts for that.  A tried and true yummy favorite of many – thanks, Jan!"
5,"Green bean casseroles aren&apos;t my favorite vegetable casseroles to make, but as far as they go, this one is great! Instead of microwaving I put everything in the casserole (minus 1/2 c cheese and the fried onions) at 350 for 20 minutes, sprinkled on the rest of the cheese and the onions, then baked for about 7 minutes more. Quick and easy."
5,DO NOT try to get away with frozen green beans in this casserole.
4,"This was pretty good and will probably be my go-to green bean casserole recipe from now on. I did make a few changes right off the bat based on the reviews of others and it turned out great.
                                
                                Here&apos;s what I did:
                                - Use french green beans instead of cut
                                - Skip microwaving ingredients
                                - Instead, mix everything together (beans, soup, ALL of cheese, and half of french fried onions) in a casserole dish
                                - Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 until hot in the middle
                                - Add more french fried onions on top of casserole
                                - Bake for another 5-10 minutes until onions are browned.
                                
                                These changes made it great! I will definitely make this one again. Very easy to throw together if you have all the ingredients so a great little casserole for weeknights."
5,"I followed Memphisbelles advice and made with cannned french cut green beans, didn&apos;t microwave and mixed in the cheese and onions (didn&apos;t add the water chestnuts) but did add some real bacon bits. Double the recipe if you need a 13X9 size. They were licking the pan clean at the party I took it to...I love when I&apos;m asked for the recipe...thanks."
5,"This is sooooo darn good ! I am hooked and I will make this ALOT !
                                I like lots of crunch so I added more onions .
                                This is a must try !!"
5,"Talk about kicking it up a notch!   Jan, this was a perfect example of how small changes can make a BIG difference.  This was so good, that my family asked me to make it AGAIN the day after Christmas!  And the reviewer who questioned that this was a recipe?  Any time you combine two or more ingredients, it&apos;s a recipe!   And an awesome one this was.... thanks for sharing."
4,"Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used fresh, yellow and green, beans for color (if you use fresh, microwave beans for about 5-7 min on high before adding other ing.) and mixed everything all together(including about 1/2 of the fried onions) except a little cheese which I set aside, to add to the top before baking. I also mixed the cheddar cheese with about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese before adding to the top. I didn&apos;t add the remaining onions until right before serving, to keep them crunchy and it was delish!
                                REMINDER: Do not add milk to soup before using. I am sure that is why some people complained about it being ""runny"""
5,This is the third time I&apos;ve made it; and we&apos;ve gotten awesome reviews. The bowl is always cleaned out. I&apos;ve preassembled this the night before and taken out an hour before to sit at room temperature and then cooked as described. Awesome and easy!!!
3,This was okay. Definitely needs some salt. I&apos;ll probably omit the cheese next time or at the very least not put any on top. It made the onions chewy instead of crunchy.
5,"Delicious! This is an easy tip and makes a big difference in taste - in a medium pan over low heat, heat up the canned pumpkin puree, spices, and salt. Heating the pumpkin puree up takes out the ""canned"" taste of the pumpkin and melds the spices together nicely. Then, pour the mixture out into another bowl, and let it cool a bit before adding the condensed milk and eggs.  This little change makes the pumpkin taste much fresher!  My family loves this recipe, and I use a ready-made graham cracker crust, so easy and so good!"
5,"This is the best pumpkin pie recipe! I get rave reviews on it every year.  I always use a ready-made graham cracker crust, and it comes out great.  One suggestion is to let the pie cool on the oven rack, because it cools more slowly that way.  If you take it out onto the kitchen counter, the filling sometimes cracks because of the cold air."
5,"Outstanding Flavor and very easy to make.  Two combinations I love.  A very sweet pie, nice appearance, and make sure to top it off with whipped cream.  This recipe is by far a 5 star!!  
                                
                                Tips:  I did not use the ginger nor the nutmeg; instead I added 2 teaspoons of ""McCormik&apos;s Pumpkin Pie Spice"" (which includes: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg, and Allspice), along with the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  My wife loved it but she thought it needed more cinnamon.  So I made the next one with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and she loved it.  If you like a lot of cinnamon, that&apos;s the way to go.  For me, I preferred 1 teaspoon, but I&apos;d eat it either way.
                                
                                Thanks EAGLE BRAND®"
5,I have never made pumpkin pie before...us Australians don&apos;t eat pumpkin pie. But I am now a convert...you guys in the U.S of A are sooo clever. I want to make and eat pumpkin pie breakfast...lunch...and dinner!!! I can&apos;t believe we don&apos;t make this over here...I am going to make it for Christmas Day again for all our visitors...if i can keep my husband and myself away from the pies for just long enough to let the visitors have a slice or 2 each. WAY BEYOND YUMMY...HEAVENLY and DIVINE are words that come to mind. I wonder if i should go down the street and buy another butternut pumpkin and make one more before Christmas Day...they say practise makes perfect lol. We don&apos;t have tinned pumpkin or pumpkin spice over here so I have to do everything myself...but maybe that makes it even nicer.
5,The easiest and best pumpkin pie I&apos;ve ever made. I followed a suggestion that someone else had made and used 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 2tsp of ground cinnamon instead. The bottom of my crust was still a tad underdone so I would suggest pre-baking the crust for a bit.
5,This is a very tasty traditional pumpkin pie. I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin which I would recommend because it is fresher and gives more texture. Also if you are using a homemade pie crust I recommend you bake it a tad before adding the filling. Otherwise the crust will get mushy. I cooked my pie for almost an hour (cooking time varies)and then cooked for 15 minutes on the very bottom rack to finish the cooking of my crust while also lightly browing the top of the pie. You end up with a perfectly spiced product perfect with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner (or anytime you crave it!).
5,"This recipe was awesome !!! Stick with the other reviewers tips and us 2 teaspoons of McCormick&apos;s Pumkin spice instead of ginger and nutmeg, I also added one teaspoon of cinnamon and warmed up  the spices and pumkin on the stove on low heat, cooling than adding the eggs and sweetened milk, it really made the spices meld together great like the other reviewer said to do. I have NEVER baked before and was able to make this recipe just perfect.  **TIP**- Where it says bake 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees....take my advice and try this- bake it at 350 degrees (after you&apos;ve done step 1 on directions of course) Bake it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, than turn off your oven and set your timer for 5 minutes while you let the pie sit in there, this way it will still cook for an additional few minutes while the oven is off but still hot and this way the oven will cool enough so that you can let the pie cool off on the top rack the remainder of the time. Doing this will prevent the pie from cracking when it hits the cool air of the counter when it&apos;s still very warm. I topped it off with cool wip and graham cracker crumbs, great texture....Thanks EAGLE BRAND!!!"
5,"Absolutely delicious and the only recipe I ever use. I do add my own twist to this recipe, though. Firstly, I heat the canned pumpkin and spices on medium heat for a few minutes, to get rid of the canned flavor. Secondly, I use 2 teaspoons of McCormick&apos;s pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I use one and a half 14 oz cans of condensed milk (I love that sweet, rich flavor - the extra condensed milk really adds an outstanding richness to this) instead of just one can, and 3 medium eggs (to compensate for the extra liquid). Even with the extra half can of milk, the filling fits in a standard 9 inch pie crust (I use a store-bought crust). I bake at 450 F for 20 minutes, and then I cover the top of the pie with aluminum foil, and then bake at 325 F for 1 hour. I then switch off the oven and let the pie cool in the oven for an hour, before I refrigerate it. Tenting with aluminum foil while baking prevents the crust from getting burnt, and letting the pie cool in the oven ensures that the top does not sink and that the center is cooked. This pie tastes best when made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight - this gives the flavors a chance to blend. I have forgotten to add salt before, and not noticed any difference. I have always received rave reviews about this - this recipe is a keeper !"
5,I have been baking pies using this recipe for years and the requests keep coming in for me to make more and more. My brother alone gets two - one to share with the family and one just for himself grin This year alone I made 10 pies and plan on making 5 more for Christmas. Definitely a big hit and I would recommend this recipe to anyone!
3,Not impressed. I followed the recipe to the letter. A thick skin developed on top of the pie that ballooned in the oven. The end result looked like a shar pei. The pumpkin itself was mild in taste and over baked.
5,"I have made this recipe for the past three years and always receive rave reviews. People who have eaten sweet potato pie all their lives say this recipe is the best they have ever tasted. I have made minor changes to suit my taste. I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I add a 1/4 tsp of cloves and ginger and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. The lemon enhances the tast of the potatoes. I also add a 1 tbsp flour to the mixture to thicken up a bit. Last, I I halve the white sugar and replace with brown sugar.  Try this and you won&apos;t be disappointed."
5,I&apos;ve made this a few times and the recipient always loves it.  One suggestion--don&apos;t store the boiled sweet potatoes in the fridge when you don&apos;t have time to make the pie right then...it separates a bit and makes the pie grainier than it needs to be.  It&apos;s much smoother when the directions are followed and it&apos;s mixed right after boiling and peeling.  :)
4,"The flavor was delicious, but it was very sweet.  The filling did not set well and was slightly loose, as a few other reviewers have noted.  However, I printed this recipe last year and just got around to trying it now.  Apparently in the meantime the recipe has been adjusted from ""1 large sweet potato"" to ""1 one-pound sweet potato"".  Perhaps this will make a difference.  In comparing this recipe to other sweet potato pie recipes, I&apos;ve noticed that most seem to call for 2 cups mashed sweet potatoes.  I don&apos;t believe my ""one large"" sweet potato equalled 2 cups mashed."
5,"I was looking for a fast, easy, sweet potato pie to bake for a church function, and came across this one.  I read about 50 of the reviews and decided it was the one I would make, but was surprised that not one of the reviews mentioned substituting canned sweet potatoes.  I didn&apos;t have an hour to bake or boil the potatoes, so I used a 17.2 oz can of sweet potatoes instead of 1 pound of fresh.  I didn&apos;t even warm them so they would be similar to the cooked, fresh sweet potatoes!  I just opened the can, drained them, and threw them in the mixing bowl with the softened butter.  I had to mix with electric mixer for a while until most of the lumps were out, but then just followed the recipe as written.  I added just a little more milk since the can was a little over 1 lb.  The pie was great, and saved me over an hour of prep time."
5,"I am a new cook and this is the first pie I ever made and it came out fantastic!!  Although I changed the recipe a little after reading the reviews I used 1/2 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, evap milk instead of regular milk, 2 teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice (I didn&apos;t have lemon extract), and homemade pie crust (stephanie&apos;s basic flaky crust at allrecipes) and it came out wonderfully creamy and the lemon juice enhanced the flavor of the sweet potatoes.  Thanks again!!  Be Blessed."
5,"This was the first sweet potatoe pie I have ever made! I never liked the taste of sweet potatoe pies before, but my boyfriend said it was time I learned to make one. So I went looking for a good sounding one and this was the one I chose. It was DELICIOUS!!!!!! the only thing I did different than the original recipe was I mixed the sweet potatoe up by itself; before adding the butter, to get all the strings out of the sweet potatoe. My boyfriend had told me about the strings... otherwise I wouldnt have known about them either. It passed his taste test, along with mine. I would say it was a winner of a recipe. thank you for submitting it!!!!!"
5,"I&apos;ve been using this recipe since 2002 and I always get rave reviews. I&apos;ve been offered money, especially during holidays to make many of these pies. The recipe is simple and absolutely perfect. At times, I will make a few variations like using 1/2 brwn sugar & 1/2 white or heavy cream instead of milk. At times even ad a tablespoon of rum extract It all depends on what I have on hand. Thanks for sharing this classic!"
5,"This is the absolute BEST recipe for a Sweet Potato Pie! I made this for Thanksgiving and 2 pies for Christmas! The flavor was outstanding, and the spices were perfect! The only thing I changed was that I added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of flour to the mixture. This addition was to help thicken the mixture. It&apos;s a little too loose if you don&apos;t add the flour. Don&apos;t be alarmed when the pie rises while baking; it&apos;ll fall when it cools. It&apos;s DELICIOUS!!!"
5,"This recipe is idot proof--I&apos;m the idiot, and here&apos;s the proof!  I was so nervous when a hospitalized friend requested a southern favorite of his, sweet potato pie, since the only thing southern about me is southern California! I totally screwed up this pie. After putting the pie in the oven to bake, I noticed the EGGS on the counter: I had forgotten to add them!  It was out of the oven, back in the bowl to add the eggs, then back in the oven.  After fifteen minutes I checked the pie, only to discover that in my panic over forgetting the eggs, I had TURNED OFF THE OVEN! So it was back out of the oven to wait for the oven to re-heat, and then back in for the rest of the cooking time.  And can you believe after all this the pie turned out PERFECT?  My friend ate two pieces at dinner and kept a third for a bedtime snack. (Either because the pie was so good, or the hospital food was so bad, we&apos;ll never know.) Thank you for this delicious--and forgiving--recipe!"
3,"this is good as far as the ingrediants~~~ however, to make it awesome... need to separate the eggs, and beat the whites until they are stiff, then stir that into the rest. NOW that makes it perfect!"
5,"This is a great way to utilize a turkey breast.  We cooked it this evening, and it was plenty for our family of three.  The spices were perfect, and the gravy was an excellent compliment.  Throw in some chopped root vegetables to roast at the same time, add a green salad, and you&apos;ve got a fantastic Fall meal!!"
5,"This was great and really easy to do.  I have never made gravy before, but using this recipe it turned out good (I did not use the half and half in my gravy, although I may try it in the future).  I could not find the exact cut of meat called for, so all I had was a 2 lb boneless, skinless turkey breast.  I did make the same amount of butter mixture and rubbed it all over the outside of the turkey breast.  My turkey did not take very long at all to cook, only about 40 minutes or so.  I used the leftover turkey and gravy in a pot pie the next day."
5,Excellent... I roasted a bone in breast following the directions as described. Used some fresh herbs for the Italian Blend removed excess skin and fat. Sat breast over potatoes onions and peppers to roast.
5,"I made this tonight. Without any prompting, my husband said he really liked it. Huge! I followed the recipe exactly.  The gravy was great too!  I would like to say that if you have the 3 lb turkey breast (Mine was Butterball brand) that comes with the netting wrapped around it, if you take the netting off, the breast loses shape. I had to re-tie with string and while it did not look as good as the turkey breast usually looks, it cooked great. It was very moist and tender and tasted wonderful too. Next time, I will not remove the netting and will just rub the outside and maybe inject the butter mix inside under the skin with my injecter set.  My injecter needle is large, so I don&apos;t think it will be clogged using my jarred minced garlic. Since it is only the 2 of us eating, I will use the lefover turkey and gravy to make a turkey pot pie this week.  I saw several good recipes on this site for that. (I served with rice and salad.  The gravy was great on the rice too!) Thanks for giving us a recipe that adds flavor to an old favorite!"
5,"This was the best Roast Turkey Breast recipe I&apos;ve ever tried. I used exactly what the recipe stated but doubled the amounts because the breast was almost 6 lbs. It took about two and a half hours to cook, and I kept the tented foil on for the first 2 hours. I basted it probably 3 times during cooking, and kept most of the drippings, (not just 1-2 Tbsp), to make the gravy. 
                                   It turned out fantastic-juicy, tasty, and an incredible gravy, which I used the next night for Turkey and Gravy in pastry shells. So much easier than cooking the whole bird, and not a scrap was leftover."
5,"The 3lb bone in breast took about 1.5hr at 350. It cooked it perfectly. I wasn&apos;t going to make the gravy because I had to open a bottle of wine and I bought pre-packaged gravy, but I made it anyways. This is some of the best gravy I ever tasted, and I made it."
5,"Perfect!  I added an extra clove of garlic and used smoked paprika instead of regular paprika (smoked paprika is the BOMB).  I also roasted it over some veggies: an onion, celery and parsnips.  Everything including the gravy was delicious!!  Note: I cooked the turkey for slightly longer than 1 1/2 hours to brown the skin."
5,"I had 2 turkey breasts about 1.7 lb each, since I couldn&apos;t find a 3lb breast in the store.  I replaced the paprika, italian seasoning and Mrs. Dash with 3 sprigs of thyme and 1 sprig of rosemary, all finely chopped.  I didn&apos;t save half the butter for later, but put it all on at the beginning and just basted with pan juices.  I also used the shallot at the beginning in the butter mixture.   The times provided in the recipe was perfect for me, and the meat was wonderfully tender. For the gravy, I used almost ALL the drippings, and I used chicken stock (not cream), which gave me a lot of delicious gravy.  (And today, I used up the gravy, along with leftover turkey and leftover stuffing, to make a turkey pot pie.)"
5,"Fabulous!  So moist and tender.  I cooked this turkey breast for Thanksgiving.  Very easy recipe.  I will use again.  I baked the turkey in my cast iron pan, and when turkey reached 165*, I removed it from pan and made gravy with drippings."
5,"Wow, these are addictive!  You better double the recipe, otherwise you will be sorry once you taste them because you will want more and more!
                                Thank you, Bibi for sharing such an amazing recipe!"
5,I got ahead of myself and didn&apos;t read all of the recipe. I combined all of the ingredients  but it still worked out really deliciously  good. Next time I will follow the directions.
4,"I had to substitute several ingredients.  For Mike&apos;s Hot Honey, I used honey + pepper flakes; Cardamom, I used 5 spice.   Cook time was 22 minutes or a little longer.    I would make this again!"
5,Really liked this. I had no trouble getting the kiddies to eat them. I will keep this recipe.
5,"Perfect as written! No changes necessary. The leaves that fell off of the sprouts while shaking were far better than any kale ""chip"" I&apos;ve ever had. I&apos;ll be trying this recipes with the leaves only. Don&apos;t get me wrong, the vinegar/bacon combo was excellent on the roasted sprouts but I will be experimenting with just the leaves after this. 5 stars all the way!"
4,Loved the recipe overall but I think I&apos;ll be cutting the salt back a bit next time round.
4,"I chose this recipe for the lower temperature of 350 F. It allowed the halved sprouts to be cooked a little longer without burning. Cooked for 12 minutes in pre-heated air fryer, tossing half way thru. Sprouts were just right. Omitted the balsamic vinegar as a personal preference. Will use this recipe again."
5,So simple and delicious.
5,Incredibly easy to make and delicious. My brussel sprout haters even loved it!
5,The combination of balsamic and bacon was great! I should have cooked the sprouts a bit longer but I will keep that in mind for next time. I just started air frying and still getting the hang of it.
4,i can give it 5 stars next time should have cooked it lil bit longer was my fault not recipes.
5,"Delicious, quick, and easy. Will make again!"
5,Very good with the balsamic vinegar and bacon bits!!
3,They were overcooked at 10 minutes. Perhaps they were smaller than the sprouts in the recipe. I will do it again but less cooking time because I love sprouts and the fryer.
5,"If I’m being honest, I purchased my pork tenderloin already seasoned with roasted garlic and cracked black pepper. I did follow everything else. The meat was so tender and juicy! The only thing that I would do differently would cook the potatoes a smidgen longer. Definitely would do again!"
5,"I was just gifted an air fryer, I had never used one before and this was the first recipe I tried in it. I didn&apos;t change anything in the recipe, except that I forgot to halve the potatoes initially so I pulled them out part way through cooking to cut them, meaning they didn&apos;t darken up as much as if I had done it right the first time. The meal still turned out great. My whole family (including two younger picky eaters) devoured the meat and potatoes (obviously not the green beans, because, vegetables). The green beans didn&apos;t look overly appetizing, but they tasted phenomenal. The pork was just perfect. I will definitely be making this dish again."
5,"Made it as stated, and was easy and pretty darn good.  Green beans were our favorite!  Nice, easy dinner that I&apos;ll use frequently!"
5,"I wasn&apos;t sure about this one, as I don&apos;t like dijon mustard, but it turned out really good. We liked it so much we had it again last night."
5,It&apos;s great
4,Wonderful x
5,"I actually used this seasoning mixture on some fresh caught Alaskan halibut, and the flavor was delightful!  I&apos;ll definitely try this on pork chops next time around."
5,They came out juicy and delicious had to cook longer cause mine where very thick but definitely make these again!!
5,"I haven’t used my air fryer in forever, and decided I wanted pork chops but not fried. Tried this recipe and it was delicious!"
5,"Quick, easy and turned out tender and juicy! So good! I&apos;ve been looking for this recipe! Will definitely make again."
5,Such simple ingredients and came out yummy. I prefer bone in. I just cooked them a little longer.
4,"Made this the other night, came out great!  My husband loved it, will definitely make again."
5,Perfect!!!  They came out so juicy.
5,"I loved it. The only thing I thing I will do differently next time is I will be more heavy handed on the ranch mix, it didn&apos;t have quite enough on it this time but was still AWESOME."
4,My Chips came out Great. Will be making them again.
5,"This was the first thing I cooked in my new Air Fryer. It&apos;s easy and the seasonings stay on the meat. It does need to cook longer then the recipe says, but it could be the size of the thighs that took longer to cook."
5,"super easy, super delicious. I cooked my chicken with skin on, bone in. They took 25-30 @ 400 degrees.  This will be a new favorite of mine."
5,Very flavorful and crispy.  I followed the recipe as noted and we loved it.  This is definitely a keeper!!
5,It turned out excellent. Will be making it again.
5,Delicious and easy recipe. I followed recipe & instructions with the following modifications:
5,"My family loves this! I just sprinkle the spices on top of the chicken instead of mixing them in a bowl. I cooked 12 min, flipped and cooked additional 12. Made with skinless thighs and also tenderloins."
5,Yummy! I added olive oil and crushed garlic. I cooked 2 at a time for 9 minutes then turn them over. I cooked extra to make chicken salad. Moist and delicious- a definite keeper.
5,Great recipe! Fast and easy. The chicken was a tad overcooked at 18 minute maybe due to my use of skinless maybe because I only buy skinless thighs - I&apos;ll play around with the time. However even at 175 internal temp the chicken was moist and tender. The spices are pretty close to perfect it would be a challenge to find any better.
3,I used bbq sauce instead of the seasonings listed in the recipe. This was the first time using the air fryer for chicken thighs. I think the basket was too close to the top and blackened the skin way before cooking the middle of the chicken. In the future I think I will bake at least half of the time first and then maybe the last 7-10 minutes switch to the air fryer option.
3,"Definitely takes longer than the time suggested from this recipe. Cooking time is ATLEAST 30 minutes! Besides having to adjust the cooking time my teenage son loved the finished result, crispy skin withOUT having to fry it."
5,OMGoodness!   Yum
5,"I haven&apos;t tried this yet, but it&apos;s brilliant! I never thought of using the air fryer to do this"
5,I love this recipe for just 2 people. Tastes like fall and so good. I bought over-sized Fuji Apples and added a bit more pecans with the same amount of brown sugar and flour and butter.
4,"This was not bad, I liked it, but one of my kids did not and she eats everything. I think the nuts (even though they were frozen when I put them in the air fryer) got too toasty for her. I&apos;m not sure I loved the flour on them - not sure it contributed anything really - but the cinnamon butter flavor was nice, especially with ice cream. Like a bit of crustless low-sugar apple pie. We will make this again."
5,Made as written and this turned out perfect. I anticipated a huge mess in the basket of my air fryer when it was done but there was hardly any mess at all. This is a great recipe!
5,"So delicious!! Easy! I love pecans toasted, but if too dark you can add halfway through and stir a few times"
5,"Delicious, fast, and easy. I omitted chili powder for husband, but am sure that would make it even better. Also, if you have a larger air fryer, no need to do in batches. Mine was ready in 12 minutes. Stirred once. Made again and put dash of ChilI powder. Delicious"
5,Cooked as the recipe. Really good. It was my trial run after getting an air fryer and I cooked up potatoes I was going to throw away. Excellent! Very excited about the possibilities.
5,These were easy and yummy. The recipe worked perfectly exactly as written. I’m hoping to try this again using sweet potatoes. I’d also like to use this recipe except with garlic and rosemary.
5,These came out great.  I had 3 pretty enormous russets so I cut them into the wedges and then cut them in half horizontally.  The spices were nice. I didn’t  use the parsley. I am out. The leftovers were great cut into cubes and fried up ina pan for breakfast home fries.
5,I used baby red potatoes cut into 4 or 6 wedges. The seasoning was flavorful and not overpowering. I&apos;m new to air frying and like recipes that turn out right the first time. I would make this again.
5,I squashed a few wedges after they were half cooked and gave them a light spray of cooking oil which gave the squashed parts a nice crunchy texture. I also used the rotisserie basket to cook them in my air fryer.
5,turned out good. I cooked them all at once. adjusted the times a little. I did cut each wedge in half.
5,My husband got me an air fryer for Christmas and this was the first recipe I tried. It was delicious! Next time I might try a pinch of cayenne in the spice mix but that&apos;s personal preference.
5,I made this and my family loved them.
3,I will make this again but I&apos;ll cook them longer for more crispiness!
5,"Thank you very much for such an easy and satisfying recipe! The one modification I did was to cut the sweet potato, then soak the fries in water for at least 10 minutes, to make them more crispy."
5,Tried sweet potato fries in the air fryer several different ways. This one was the best by far!
5,Delish!  I dusted mine with cinnamon sugar.  SO GOOD!
5,"I just bought a small air fryer and this was the first item I cooked in it.  I followed the recipe as is, except I used regular salt instead of Kosher salt (didn&apos;t have any).  Turned out great!  I adjusted the time according to the size of the batches. Instead of adding all the ingredients in a bowl, I put them all in a large baggy and shook it up.  Easy cleanup.  My husband (who&apos;s the biggest fan for sweet potatoes) loved them and asked for them to be made again the next day.  Thank you for the recipe."
5,"This came out great, highly recommended. You can do an average sized sweet potato in one round rather than the two or three in the recipe."
3,I&apos;m new to using an air fryer.  These turned out a bit soggy and not crisp.  But that may have been due to my technique.  So I will try at least a couple more times to get them to come our crisp.  The flavor was very good.  The seasoning mixture was just right for the sweet potatoes.
5,I enjoyed making theses simple fries but with a great taste.
5,So delicious! I played with the size of the fries and added 30 seconds frying time to get them crispy.
4,"These were good, but still not as crispy as I would like. I followed one reviewers suggestion of soaking the potato fries in water first. I soaked for at least a half hour and still not real crispy. I&apos;m thinking there is no way to make sweet potato fries crispy other than actually deep frying. This is still a good option."
5,"Amazing fries!  These were so good, and just the perfect balance of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I made them just as the recipe directed, and we loved them!"
5,"Great recipe,  i&apos;ve been making them this way for quite a while.  i like to add salt and garlic powder to mine.  These work amazingly well for chili fries, or cheesey fries also.   sprinkle shredded cheese on them before tossing with the season so it melts best."
5,Followed the recipe exactly and dumped 1# into my 5 quart fryer. Worked great. I am not sure the boiling water step is required but I’ll experiment some more.
5,"Easy and delicious! I cut into steak fries because that’s what hubs prefers. Also use regular salt and no cayenne.
                                Definitely worth the extra steps for perfect fries."
5,Followed recipe except I added some turmeric for color and bit of smoked paprika. I added sea salt right before serving. They looked and tasted delicious and all gone!
5,I made this last night with delicious burgers! I also made my homemade fry sauce to go with the fries it was delicious! Easy an the kids loved it!
5,"Dusted off the air fryer I got for Christmas 2 years ago! This recipe made great fries. I soaked the peeled fries in hot tap water 15 minutes, 3 times to remove starch, followed recipe exactly otherwise. They were crispy and delicious! Thanks, Chef John!"
5,Made them in a Foodi. Used garlic flavored olive oil - excellent!
5,Made per directions
4,"This is the first air fryer recipe that I have found that I really like!!  I recently purchased an Emeril Lagasse power air fryer, and generally speaking have found it lacking. Every time I followed one of their protein recipes, I found the protein to be undercooked and rubbery. That did not happen w this recipe. That being said I did make some adjustments. I lengthened the cooking time to 25 minutes. 15 mins side one and 10 mins for side two. Regarding the croutons I felt that a bit labor intensive so instead I used panko bread crumbs combined w a 1/4c of Parmesan and 1tsp of garlic powder. And I only needed one egg to coat 4 chops. The time may just be my Emeril air fryer but it worked perfectly. It also defaults to 400* for air fry setting so I left it at that. But the basics of this are great, and I will definitely do it again!"
5,"I just got an air fryer yesterday and needed to try it out (beyond just some frozen taquitos) :). This was quite easily the best pork chops I&apos;ve made, super moist! I used panko bread crumbs with garlic salt and onion powder instead of the croutons and Cajun seasonings (didn&apos;t have those)."
5,Made as directed.  First time doing pork chops in the air fryer. Turned out probably the juiciest chops ever. Will definitely make it again!!!
5,Very good!  Next time I will add more Cajun seasoning.  We would have liked a bit more spice.  But the crust was crunchy and the pork chops tender and cooked through.
5,"A simple, yet very tasty recipe!  I used thick cut chops (about 1.5 inches thick), and found that 11 minutes per side were necessary, to achieve an internal temp of 160 degrees.  Crisp on the outside & juicy on the inside."
5,Juicy pork chops with a crispy breading - will definitely make again!
5,I found that i needed to add two minutes per side to crisp the bread crumbs.
5,I couldn&apos;t believe how good these were and tue clean up was so easy too!
5,I used bread crumbs.  They were delicious..juicy.  ?? more air frying recipes would be appreciated!!
3,Tasted good but I had to cook them for 20 minutes For them to be done and tender. I followed directions carefully and my chops were only 1/2 inch thick.  Did I do something wrong?  Will make again.
5,I added extra parmesan cheese because we loooove cheese and used teriyaki sauce to give it a lil bang it was soooo good!
5,"Easy as cake! I made some adjustments for personal taste, but this is in HEAVY rotation in my house!"
5,"Really good.  I was shocked that I actually had all the ingredients.
                                I made my meatballs the size of billiard balls so I had them in the air fryer for 14 minutes at 350.    I used my meat thermometer to verify that they were cooked inside. I followed the recipe exactly as shown.   Definitely use the ice cream scoop to make your meatballs uniform."
5,This recipe is so easy and so good.  The only thing I did different is we only had elk meat instead of regular hamburger.
5,What a great simple recipe!  I quadrupled the recipe and was able to get half of all of my meatballs into my large air fryer.  The flavor was great and my husband was extra happy that I didn&apos;t use onions to make them.  The meatballs have great flavor and I look forward to making this again.
5,Just got the air fryer and was a little hesitant how these would come out.  DELICIOUS!  Made no changes to the recipe.
5,These were delicious.  I made them smaller - slightly bigger than a golf ball and 10 min was good in air fryer. Used the two cloves of garlic but they were big cloves. They were still awesome. This one is a keeper.
5,Came out great!
5,Excellent! The kids loved them!
5,Loved them. Added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.
5,"I will never make hot dogs any other way. This is pure genius. The hot dogs in my Philips air fryer needed about 5 minutes. I made slits in them to give more crispiness. I also used gluten free buns, which needed more time. Thank you for the recipe."
5,"Got a new air fryer and had to try it out. Figured before I tried something more substantial, I couldn&apos;t possibly ruin a hot dog. I was right. The hotdogs tasted just like we had grilled them outside and the toasted buns were wonderful.  Great first outing with the air fryer. Now I have some confidence that I can make something more expensive and not ruin it. Thanks for all the reviews that gave me the angst to try it myself.
                                Kathy Acord"
5,"I cooked turkey hot dogs in my air fryer oven      I checked them after three minutes and they weren&apos;t done so I continued cooking them for another three minutes.  I did rotate them and made slits in them.  They came out great!   We normally make in microwave or frying pan.  This is the best way!
                                
                                Next time I’m going to try using the rotisserie option on the skewers."
2,Wasn&apos;t a fan. Will stick to steaming.
4,"I love them in the air fryer too, but I cook the dogs first for 6 min. Then I put them in the buns and cook everything for another 3-4 minutes."
4,A few minutes in the fryer and they were fantastic!
5,"I just made my second meal with my small air fryer.  I had 2 long all-beef wieners that were frozen.  I put them in the microwave on defrost for 2 minutes, which thawed them just enough for easier cutting.  I cut them in half and placed them in the air fryer at 400 degrees.  I set the timer for 5 minutes.  Then because I really like them really browned, I turned them and cooked them for another 3 minutes.  They were perfect for me and my husband."
5,"8.20.20  A horrendous thunder, lightening, rain storm blew through yesterday evening dumping 7” of rain, so cooking out was not an option.  Potato salad and baked baked beans were done, and instead of frying hamburgers and making yet another mess to clean up, decided to try this recipe for hot dogs using the air fryer.  It works folks, enough said!  Seriously, I don’t know that you get that much more flavor grilling hot dogs, and it’s doubtful I’ll even bother again. Being able to toast the buns in the air fryer also is a plus, it makes a difference. Admittedly, this one surprised me, it’s simply good!"
4,dog were a little more done then expected but all in all was good
5,Perfect as written! The shell gets so crispy but the inside is nice and fluffy. My husband said it was the best baked potato he has ever had. He even ate the entire peel which is unlike him. I  guess I know how I will be preparing baked potatoes from now on. 5 star recipe all the way! Thanks Bren!
5,"It was exactly what I was hoping for!  I used bacon grease to rub over the potato skin, and cooked according to the directions.  The potatoes turned out great!"
5,"Wow, I never would&apos;ve thought to do this, although I adore my air fryer!  Last night I rubbed a good-sized baker potato and a sweet potato with duck fat, then sprinkled with sea salt, and into the air fryer for 30 minutes at 390*, then turned them both over and another 30 minutes at 380*.  PERFECTION.  Fluffy inside, crusty skin, just the way I like it.  Thanks for this great idea!"
3,1 hour was way to long! Maybe 20 - 30 min
5,"Always loved to order a really well done baked potato at a Steak House. The Air Fryer baked potato lives up to the Steak House version I love. I Gooped (my husband&apos;s term) up the potatoes with butter, sour cream and grated cheese, bacon bits and snipped chives."
5,Best Baked Potato. Fluffy inside salty crisp skin.
5,So simple and so good.  My Patoots were done in 40 minutes...
5,"I loved this recipe and only changed to olive oil instead of peanut, didn&apos;t have that on hand. The smell reminds me of the old way of wrapping the potato in foil and throwing in the grill with charcoal. The taste is great and I will never make a baked potato in the microwave ever again. I look forward to more air fryer recipes."
5,This recipe is amazing worked perfectly. No corrections necessary even for Denver&apos;s altitude.
5,Made exactly as written using Panko breadcrumbs and these were perfect as written. Plan on 20 minutes for your airfryer to preheat and do not over fill your basket. The chicken pieces should not be touching each other if you want that crispness on all sides.
5,"I have not tried this exact recipe, but I&apos;ve done chicken in my air fryer for over a year, nuggets, strips, whole pieces, wings, with various coatings, sauces, and even plain. . 
                                
                                I read this recipe in the special chicken issue earlier today, and noted the comment from a reviewer stating that you should preheat your air fryer for 20 minutes. I just received my copy of America&apos;s Test Kitchen ""Air Fryer Perfection"" and they tested whether  or not you should preheat your air fryer. One of the virtues of air fryers is that they come up to heat very rapidly, within a minute or two. 
                                ATK did not think preheating was necessary and neither do I. 
                                It wastes time and electricity. Turning and rotating the food halfway through cooking, or shaking the basket, will insure that
                                all sides are crispy.  Also, she was right about not overloading the basket."
5,"This was delicious! I’ve never mixed panko with oil before, and I’ll never bread chicken any other way from now on. I used Italian-style panko and cut 3 chicken cutlets into strips for the hubby. I prefer chicken thighs, so I kept those whole (boneless). Breaded all of it using this method (had to double the breading mixture for that much), and cooked in batches for 15mins each (2 batches). No flipping needed, and it was crispy, crunchy goodness! Thanks for sharing!"
4,"With a few tweaks this has became a staple weeknight meal in my house. I mix the egg with dijon mustard and spices and leave the chicken in it for 30 minutes to marinate. Then I dip and coat in the breadcrumbs.
                                The breadcrumbs mixed with the oil is something I had never done before but it is a game changer! Again I usually had a touch of seasoning to the breadcrumbs but overall this is a solid base recipe."
5,Great! Cut up 3 chicken breast into thin strips Coated in mixture of seasoned garlic and herb bread and panko crumbs. Added cayenne and garlic powder to crumbs. Used 3 beaten eggs and didn&apos;t preheat airfryer. That was a mistake because it took longer for first batch. I set at 370 degrees for approx. 12 minutes. Served with homemade buffalo sauce. My family loved them. Great crispiness and flavor.
5,Perfect! First air fryer recipe used and it was a hit with me and my husband! For my personal preferences I added onion powder paprika garlic powder salt and pepper. This time I will use a full cup of crumbs since I like the extra crunch. Thank you for sharing! (Not in recipe-but in every air fryer you should always flip your food at the halfway mark)
5,These turned out great!!! I added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch to the panko and it really made for a flavorful breading.
5,It was crispy and delicious! I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before breading it and I also added a bit of salt and pepper to the bread crumbs. I will definitely make this again!
4,This turned out great! I did a double batch whisked in some honey mustard and pepper with the eggs and used lemon flavoured olive oil with Panko crumbs. I did 3 tenders in the basket at a time for 10min on 180C after preheat so it took a bit of time to cook them all. Will do again!
1,"BLAH! I made it a super is, no changes to the recipe.  It looked crispy and amazing but tasted too bland and more like it was baked in the oven. Will try a different recipe next time"
5,Wow. I just finished making these and thought they were just WONDERFUL. I didn&apos;t use cauliflower or asparagus (didn&apos;t have) and added red onion chunks. Actually I bought the veggies already skewered and added 1-inch Korean style meatballs (fully cooked). Also added a little balsamic vinegar to the oil. Taste was out of this world. May try smoked sausage with the veggies next time. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe!!
5,I increased the air fryer time to about 12-13 minutes.
5,On my journey to vegetarian and losing 30 lbs I needed a healthier snack this was a great way to eat smarter. New to air frying the spice and oil ratios were very helpful though I used ghost pepper salt with whatever veggies I had in the fridge. Carrots Brussel sprouts chili peppers broccoli all great cucumbers not so much oh well I had to try.
5,I omitted the mushrooms and used my rotisserie basket. Kept everything the same. My husband loved this and it had a couple veggies he didn&apos;t think he would like.
5,Delish...this was quick easy and very tasty.
5,I love using the air fryer to Friday veges. This recipe is so versatile. only thing is if you are using root vegetables I suggest cooking them separately or at least by then selves for the first 5 minutes as they take longer to cook
5,"Wish I could upload a pic but no size adjustment is working. I did an 8 serving size for 20 min, shaking it every 5 min. I would’ve used less pepper and more salt. Plus, I added mince garlic with my veggies—summer squash, mushrooms, sweet peppers, red onions."
3,I ended up cutting potatoes in half.  They were small Yukon and red. I cooked carrots for 10 minutes. Cooked potatoes for 10 minutes. Then threw all back in and added onions cooking at 400° for 10 minutes. I marinated them in Ken&apos;s Italian dressing. They were good just ran dinner late. I&apos;m sure I cooked more than 30 minutes.
5,"Sooooo good & soooo easy. Th only things I skipped were the  pepper & mushrooms simply because I don&apos;t like them & oil because I didn&apos;t feel it was needed & it wasn&apos;t.  The loaf was moist & tender, held its shape & tasted yummy. I&apos;ll be repeating this experience again."
4,"I made this, delicious! Changed it for my fryer, no oil or mushrooms and used crushed crackers.. Split meatloaf into 4 equal balls. cooked it at 365f for 8 minutes, then coated with catsup and cooked for another 5 mins, perfect."
1,"i made meat loaf in the air fryer and I couldn&apos;t get it up to temperature (165 degrees) so i had to throw it out.  when i researched cooking meat loaf in an air fryer, i discovered that the only benefit of cooking this way is that it reduces cook time"
5,This recipe cooking in an air fryer was truly one of the best meatloafs my husband and I have eaten in years!   I used Panko bread crumbs and did not use the mushrooms but lighly wiped olive oil on top -the top of the loaf was brownish black and DELICIOUS!
5,Excellent! Left off the thyme and put more ketchup and onions. We all love it!
5,It was delicious!!  I will be making this one again.  The only other ingredient I added was one tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.
4,This was a very good meat loaf. I will make it again. The cooking time was perfect.
1,"Time/Temp was off, burnt the top and didn&apos;t cook the middle. May try again but will have to make adjustments."
5,No changes
4,I followed the instructions but had to cook a smaller portion and they came out a little burned. In another recipe for Brussels sprouts from the airfryer it said about 2 x 5 minutes on 350 degrees or 175 celcius. That seems safer. But apart from that.. nice recipe!
4,"Actually, after reading all the comments I also lessen the time to 10 min., @ 350. They were tender not mushy inside and crispy outside. I also added minced garlic, onion and bacon to mine."
5,I made exactly from recipe and they were perfect. Will definitely make again.
4,Simple and delicious! The one problem I did have or almost had was with the cooking time. I went to shake them at 8 minutes and they were pretty charred. I turned them over and went for another 2 minutes. Any longer and they would have burnt. Next time I might cut them in half to get the flavor more throughout. Overall great recipe just watch them closely so you don&apos;t end up burning them.
5,"How to make Brussels sprouts without smelling up the house. I loved the simplicity of this recipe. I used a Philips Viva air fryer and found that at 7 or 8 minutes they were almost burnt. I turned down the temp to 160C for another 5 minutes and they were crispy outside, tender - not mushy inside. There are many variables to consider (machine, size of vegetables, etc.), but this is definitely a fantastic way to cook Brussels sprouts! Thank you for the recipe."
4,"These were really easy and tasty but, like the other reviewers, I felt like they started to burn halfway through. I reduced the cook time by a few minutes and then turned off the air fryer and let them sit inside for a few more minutes to keep cooking with residual heat."
4,"Flavor was excellent for the brussels sprouts. Easy to make and literally simple too! I have a Pampered Chef Air  Fryer and am glad I tried cooking these at 350F (accident as I confused this recipe with another recipe). However, my brussels sprouts took longer to cook and even after 15 min they weren&apos;t tender enough to me on the inside and seemed to be drying out like brussels sprouts chips. Any longer and they would have been charred. I halved them out of habit though too. I think brussels sprouts are not for me using the air fryer, which is of no fault to the recipe author. Flavors were still very good following ingredient amounts as directed. Thanks for the recipe FF5!"
4,"This has potential but as written you will end up with very burnt bacon. I went ahead and experimented with the entire pound package. The basket only holds a few pieces at a time so this was quite a lengthy test. On the very last batch I got it right. I ended up reducing the temp to 350, cooking it for 5 minutes, flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Another helpful hint is to cut your bacon pieces in half prior to putting them in the basket. If you do not, the pieces that overlap never get as done as crisp as the parts that are not overlapping."
2,this recipe makes Almost Burnt Bacon. some people  like that. I don&apos;t at all. I want melt in my mouth Bacon. 350 cook 6 flip then 4 more I feel is perfect. not gummy at all crispy without the meat overcooking and becoming tough. add water to the bottom to prevent the smoke detector from telling your neighbors it&apos;s bacon time.
5,"We like our bacon crispy but not burnt. After several tests, I settled on 3 minutes on each side at 390 degrees. That is cooking 5 half strips at a time. Very tasty and quick. Tradeoff is the multiple batches required if you&apos;re cooking a whole pound of bacon."
5,made half a package. cooked for about 7-8 minutes and it was done perfectly. I&apos;m sure time cooked varies based on different air frying ovens. Still quicker easier and less mess than conventional pan frying.
5,Turned out Perfecto!
5,"This was deeeelish and the perfect method for the air fryer! 
                                
                                The only thing I switched up was that I sprinkled some brown sugar on top of the bacon about halfway through. So good!"
1,"My air fryer makes fantastic bacon in 7-8 minutes if preheated to 390°. This method would burn my bacon to a blackened mess! I also recommend cutting package in half and placing the 1/2 strips around the basket with minimal overlap. Check with 2-3 min remaining and turn, toss, or shake up as needed for most even cooking."
5,no changes...delicious
1,"Burnt! So much so I threw it away. And if I won’t eat a piece of bacon, it’s really really bad"
4,I loved this idea. I did have to bake longer than recipe called . Really was a good parring with any type of meat entree.
4,I added a small slice of bacon to each slit!  Yummy!!
5,"Fantastic, my new favorite way to make potatoes!"
4,Great side option for a meal and it was delicious!
3,Had to throw it in the micro to finish it off
4,"I microwaved the potatoes for 4 mins first.  then cut the potatoes and seasoned, placed in my outside air fryer.  Took about 20 mins to finish."
5,"This was delicious. I used small potatoes, but they were still crispy outside with tender insides. Great recipe."
4,We loved these potatoes!  So simple and they deliver a great taste with that gourmet look!  I did need a couple more tablespoons of butter but hey that’s me! Great recipe!!!!
5,"Easy,perfect. Came out restaurant quality!"
5,Ok so I&apos;m new to air frying just bought one a few months ago. All the recipes I found for ribeye steaks were for grilling only grilling in November in Idaho isn&apos;t all that feasible so when I found this method I decided to give it a try. The author was vague as to which pan to use. My air fryer came with three options; a slatted grill type basket and a solid pan. After much consideration I decided to use the pan so the steaks would cook in their juices. Also the author assumes we all have steak seasoning on hand which I did not so I made my own. Mix in a small cup 1.5 tsp salt 1.5 tsp pepper 1.5 tsp garlic powder half tsp paprika half tsp onion powder quarter tsp rosemary quarter tsp thyme. Then I spooned out the 4 tsp and added to oil and soy sauce in a gallon zip lock bag. Added steaks. Squeeze out air. Put flat in fridge. Again the author was vague but I know how to cook and meat should never be cooked from a cold state so I marinated the steaks for 2 hours in the fridge turning every hour to mix. Then I took them out and let them come to room temp on the counter for another 4-6 hours. Super good!
3,Fine for the winter months when you can&apos;t grill. Steak did turn out nice and pink and juicy but the texture was different than with grilling.
4,"Made as written and this turned out pretty good. It was too salty though and I like salt. Grilling is still the way to go in my opinion but if weather doesn&apos;t permit, this is a great stand-by method."
5,My husband was so upset I was putting our rib eyes in the air fryer...until they came out! He was amazed. I used my own seasonings. The timing on this is perfect!  When it is just the two of us we will prob never grill our steak again.
5,I made it and it was perfect. I am not eating soy so I substituted balsamic vinegar (half). Otherwise cooked per instructions.
5,Really comes out great.  Just give it a nice sear after removing from the air fryer and then let is marble
5,It was my first time making something with rib eye steak and it was amazing will definitely make again.
4,use personal marinade and reduce time perfect steak.
4,Very good. The ready in 2 h 25m is wrong. It&apos;s ready in about 20 or 30. Good taste for sure.
5,"Wow, these are addictive!  You better double the recipe, otherwise you will be sorry once you taste them because you will want more and more!
                                Thank you, Bibi for sharing such an amazing recipe!"
5,Was great
5,PERFECT!    I was gifted an air fryer but no instruction book.  This recipe made it so easy as the times were perfect!  I only wish I had taken a photo but they disappeared before I thought about it.   Next time.  Thank you Nicole for sharing!   I miss our times on the buzz!
5,Toss some tater tots in the air fryer heat up some salsa con queso and serve with a dollop of sour cream and you have one easy tasty afternoon snack. It doesn t get any easier than this.
5,Super easy. Tots were crispy and we topped them with Tillamook cheddar cheese at the end.
5,Easy and very yummy. Could not get enough.
5,Good!!
5,They were really good.
5,Very delicious flavoring! I added some Panko seasoning to give it a crunch! Served with butter and it was delicious!
5,The shrimp was perfectly succulent and the flavorings were tasty!
4,Easy!
4,This was easy and delicious
5,This was quick and easy. Not to mention light and tasty. I will make it again but will probably use jumbo shrimp. So they don t fall through the rack.
4,Made this recipe exactly as written.  It was very tasty. Will definitely make again. I think I’ll reduce the cooking time by a minute or so next time.
5,Super easy and delicious! Followed recipe exactly.
5,"Really tasty, really fast, perfectly cooked in the air fryer"
5,Really good recipe. It didnt last more than 5 minutes. Will be making again
3,I used Lemon Pepper and Old Bay. Next time I will add a couple drops of Tabasco w/ olive oil and lemon juice. and maybe try it cold in a tossed salad w/ olive  oil and lemon juice dressing.
5,These were delicious will definitely make again. There&apos;s nothing difficult here just time consuming. The eggs I used were a bit too fresh so they didn&apos;t peel very well and I lost one in the process (I ate it!). But using five eggs worked out perfectly with the amount of sausage called for. It&apos;s a must to use Jimmy Dean regular sausage don&apos;t cheap out and use anything else!
4,The eggs turned out good - the dipping sauce was a little sweet for me.
5,"Absolutely loved these! Only changes I made were leaving out the flour and using crushed pork rinds instead of panko so they would be low carb and gluten free. 
                                
                                I didn’t try the sauce because I’m cutting out sugar, but the eggs themselves were heavenly!"
5,I made this for dinner tonight. I used hot sausage and omitted the spices from the chutney sauce.   They came out very well and tasted great!
5,"These are very good. I used a mixture of regular pork sausage and smoked pork sausage and it was terrific. 
                                I almost didn&apos;t make the chutney dip as we all like the mustard so much with these. But I did and it was also delicious. I made triple amount of the dip and it was all gone as people were dipping everything in it. 
                                The eggs came out of the air fryer crunchy just as if they had been fried. 
                                Definitely a keeper!"
5,Best scotch eggs ever! These are crispy yet still moist. 1 thing I did differently was spray them on all sides with cooking spray. And because they aren t deep fried the flavor of the egg and sausage really come through. Thanks for this!
5,These were amazing!
5,Not as difficult to make as I thought it would be. The breading stayed on really well. I fried it into batches in the air fryer. The outside was nice and crispy. I served it with English muffins and a salad
4,I did these in 2 batches; first batch per the recipe. 2nd batch without the breading. 2nd batch turned out much better. I also used turkey breakfast sausage as we don&apos;t eat pork. Very tasty!
4,"I am still trying to win the war with my air fryer, but this recipe gave me hope for its future!  I tried a piece of eggplant before adding sauce and cheese (which I did in the regular broiler because I was picturing mess in the air fryer) and I loved it.  Actually liked it more without the sauce and cheese!  Next time I will probably made them and a dip instead, but will definitely make them again.  That was also my first time making eggplant, so thank you for the inspiration!"
5,I never would have thought you could cook eggplant in the air fryer. When I saw this recipe I knew I had to give it a try. OMG I&apos;m so glad I did. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out soooo good. Even my husband who thinks he doesn&apos;t like eggplant tried a piece and then went back for more. And this was really so easy to make. What a great dinner with some garlic bread.I will definitely make this again. Thank you for such a great recipe. My air fryer is my new favorite toy so I appreciate new recipes to try. This one is a keepa!
5,"I layered it with sauce and mozzarella in the oven for just 5-10 minutes after air-frying it. My father in law who has never had eggplant and needed a non-meat meal for lent, loved it."
5,"This was great! I am a big fan of eggplant parm, and a new air fryer owner. My husband and I absolutely loved this, and it is healthier than what I use to make too! I also did not add the extra spices as I knew they were already in the Italian breadcrumbs. I also used panko  Italian breadcrumbs and I hand grated Parmesan-Romano cheese in the breadcrumb mixture. Yum!!!"
5,These tasted better than eggplant parmesan that was baked in the oven. The crisp eggplant was very satisfying and overall the entire meal was fresh and delicious.
5,Made as described. Awesome! I m new to
5,Excellent   I used fresh mozzarella and ricotta  and Parmesan. Fabulous.
5,First time using my air fryer and it was a delicious success! The only thing I changed or added was I spread a little ricotta cheese on the baked eggplant then topped it with mozzarella. I also did not put the sauce on the eggplant until the cheese was melted. Served it with homemade marinara sauce and fresh angel hair pasta. Keeper recipe!
4,Easy/Peasy
3,"I loved using the air fryer to cook the eggplant, but my husband didn’t like all the “extra” spices.     They overwhelmed the taste a bit.  I’ll use the air fryer again to cook the eggplant, but stick to regular Italian bread crumbs without extra add-ins.  Much healthier without all the oil.   The timing was spot-on for the cooking time.  I even froze the cooked extra slices for another time."
4,Quick and easy.
5,delicious
5,Super easy...very flavorful. Will definitely do it again.  Only slight modification was that I left out brown sugar since I’m trying to reduce sugar. Still fantastic.
5,This was so yummy! Followed the recipe exactly except I used sage and thyme in place of poultry seasoning since I didn’t have any. I would add a pic but I ate it too fast!
5,"Followed directions, very yummy and the hint of the brown sugar gives it a lil sweetness that is sooo good."
5,Great recipe — easy to follow and pretty straight-forward. The wings turned out great and had a fabulous lunch
5,it was delicious exactly as directions were told
3,"My criticism is of the rub used in this. I  used it on leg quarters, and adjusted the cooking time. The technique worked well, but I did not care for this rub on chicken.  I&apos;ll use the technique again, but with a different rub."
5,My husband and kids really liked it. My youngest has celiac and misses having good tasting wings at restaurants.
5,"adjusted the seasonings to taste.   I love the air fryer,its simple to use."
5,GREAT flavor!  I&apos;d use thicker chops next time or cut time by a few minutes if you only have thin ones!
5,My boneless pork chops were only about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick. I did them for about 4 minutes on each side. They were wonderful.
5,Thank you and everyone else for posting these Air Fryer recipes! I love my Air fryer but it takes some getting use to!
5,"Delicious, came out  very moist, great flavor!"
4,I made it just like the recipe and it was GEEAT. We&apos;ll be making it a lot more often.
5,Loved it.
5,This was the best pork chop I have ever had.  It was very juice and tasty.  I only made one because that was all I had so had to throw away a lot of leftover ingredients but it was certainly worth it.  I will definitely do two chops the next time.
4,These chops came out so moist and tender. With a couple of changes I would definitely make this recipe again. In my house we love a crispy pork chop so next time; I may try adding some panko in with the parmesan cheese and see if that gets it there. We also found that the seasoning wasn&apos;t enough but other than that we really enjoyed this as it was a healthier option to deep frying and cleanup was a breeze.
3,Yea it was ok pastry was hardest part I now vall it apple crumble I made a big mess wife told me I better clean when done lol
5,These were easy to make and so good! Didn t change the recipe and liked adding the grape seed oil to make a nice brown top. Make sure all the apples are sealed inside. Yum!
5,I didn&apos;t have premade crust and just used my normal 1-crust recipe with butter instead of shortening. I also halved the recipe but I did end up with too much crust. Next time I think I will still halve the recipe but divide it into 4 smaller pies (not that any went wasting) maybe using a larger apple or 2 small ones to get a bit more sauce I didn&apos;t need any cornstarch to thicken. It was very yummy with ice cream. It really does cook in 8 minutes at 390 (I don&apos;t have 385 option on my air fryer). I also didn&apos;t use the glaze it was tasty without since my pie shell recipe is buttery.
5,Delicious!  Will do again and again with different fruits.
5,I used 5 tbsp brown sugar because I try to cut back on sugar if I making something myself. I did not have grapeseed oil so I lightly brushed olive oil. Overall very good dessert.
1,"super hard to make, dough stuck to fork, filling ran out. It was a total mess."
5,This was super easy for a weeknight dessert. I did follow the suggestion of cutting the sugar and butter in half and it was the perfect sweetness for me. Mine didn&apos;t turn out nearly as pretty but they were very tasty. I would have needed to double the recipe of the glaze to get them as frosted as the pic... I ended up just kind of drizzling what I had and it covered them nicely.
5,"Wow.... How delicious were this Apple Pie. This recipe is quick and easy. If you like the McDonalds apple pie your sure to like this one.
                                 I did make a few changes only because was&apos;t sure if I was going to like it and didn&apos;t want to make to many either. But was not to like...
                                 I used 1 granny smith & 1 pink lady apples instead and it was enough to make 4 apple pies which was enough for the two of us. I baked them at 180 degrees on a fan force oven for 15 min or until golden in color ."
5,These were fairly easy and really good! I didn’t have grape seed oil so I sprayed some butter on them instead. They were delicious! My filling didn’t thicken up very much (maybe because I quadrupled the recipe) so some of the juice ran out as I was filling the crusts but they still sealed fine.
5,Yummy wick treat
1,"Be careful! If you are doing this with an air fryer, make sure you are using perforated parchment paper! Otherwise it&apos;ll burn and start a fire, which will ruin your appliance."
5,"I used Bisquick—these were really, really good. And so very quick to make! Will definitely make again as my whole family enjoyed them."
5,super easy and delicious!
5,Very good
4,Used milk instead of water. Doesn’t taste like I thought they would but they’re still good!
1,Taste was not good
5,Kids enjoy. I use milk instead of water
2,"I nearly set my house on fire ... apparently you are not supposed to put the paper into the air fryer when preheating and my basket has to be inside to preheat. 
                                
                                Flames were flying out of my air fryer and the paper turned to ash..."
5,"This recipe has served me well for years.  Whenever we have overnight company, everyone insists these are the best pancakes they&apos;ve ever eaten.  For those afraid of sour milk, it is simply a substitute for buttermilk.  I use soured milk in every recipe that I have that calls for buttermilk and it works like a charm.  It does NOT make things taste sour!  Another note: the pancakes will start to ""foam up"" after you stir them.  Resist the urge to stir them again.  All those bubbles is what makes them so fluffy.  The batter will be very thick and difficult to pour at this point.  Also, as others have said, this does not serve 8.  In my house, it serves 4 of us.  Enjoy."
5,"I used real buttermilk instead of soured milk and doubled the recipe. I let the batter sit for 10 minutes while my griddle heated up. There were no survivors. We ate every last bit. I served this with Absolute Best Pancake Syrup. EDITED: I use this pancake recipe frequently because it&apos;s incredibly easy. Now I make this lactose-free by using lactose-free milk and either melted margerine or vegetable oil in place of the butter. I like to use whole wheat flour off and on but when I do, I always increase the milk by a quarter cup because whole wheat flour tends to soak up the liquids a little more than AP flour. This doubles and triples well as well as freezes/rewarms well. Sometimes, I&apos;ll triple the recipe and freeze the leftovers and on busy days, I pop them into the toaster to reheat. Easy peasy lemon squeezy."
5,"I have made this recipes about 40 times since finding it about 3 mos ago.  My daughter won&apos;t eat anyone&apos;s pancakes but mine!  one tip:  This morning I forgot to add the butter, and they were better than ever. Lighter, taller, fluffier!  Soaked up the syrup and kept its texture!  AWESOME! THANKS SO MUCH!"
4,"Classic recipe for really ""Fluffy"" pancakes! I always have buttermilk handy so I used that instead of doing sour milk as I find the real stuff does make a difference. But, if you don&apos;t have it on hand the milk/vinegar method is good in a pinch. I added a tsp. of vanilla for good measure, added the wet ingredients to the dry ones and didn&apos;t overmix these. Having a few lumps in the batter is a good thing! I let it rest for a few minutes while the frying pan heated up and WOW - they really puffed up nicely! These were perfect topped with butter and REAL maple syrup."
5,"i followed this recipe exactly and they were great!! they turned out very well the kids gobbled them up no more box mix for me!! thanks for sharing this recipe:-)UPDATE: made these again and they turned out even better this time the only thing i did different was let the milk ""sour"" a bit longer added a teaspoon of vanilla and sugar just a tip double the recipe as the original does not make too many!!"
5,I have been using Alton Brown&apos;s pancake mix recipe for the past few years and I didn&apos;t think pancakes could get any better.  I was wrong!!  These are outstanding!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!
5,"New family recipe. They were nice and tender and the ingredients were all in the cupboard. I doubled the recipe also. If this is 8 servings, it is one little pancake for 8 people. Double or triple the recipe for your family. They puffed up while cooking but were not heavy at all but nice and light. Do not overmix these and let them sit for a 1/2 hour after mixing before frying. The batter thickens and is nice. UPDATE: This is still our favorite pancake recipe but tried making these the night before, putting them in the refrigerator and making in the morning. Works great and convenient, especially when you have a busy morning schedule.  It deserves 5 with doubling the recipe. Just change the serving size to 16 and it is better for  4-6 servings."
5,"These are the best pancakes ever.  I doubled the recipe, I think you need to, and if you have leftovers, they freeze very well.  My son-in-law took them one step further, and I thought it was too much work, but when I saw the difference I will always incorporate the final step in this recipe.  He seperated the two eggs (double recipe) and whipped the egg whites untill they were stiff.  He followed the recipe, incorporating the egg yolks into the mixture, adding the egg whites last, gently folding them in.  If you liked the recipe before, you will LOVE it with this additional step."
3,"I always use lemon juice instead of vinegar for my soured milk. That being said, I feel like the proportions were a little odd in this recipe. Not sure what it was, but the flavor seemed a little unbalanced and ""after-tastey"". I usually do 1 TBS vinegar/lemon juice to 1 C milk for sour milk, (this recipe calls for 2 TBS acid to 3/4 C milk) so maybe there was too much acid. I had high hopes for this recipe, but it wasn&apos;t our favorite, sorry."
4,Really good! Could use a bit more filling and mine were a little dryer than I would have liked but the flavor and instructions were excellent! Thanks for your contribution!
5,Made it just as it was written. Everyone loved them and it was easy!!!!
5,I made a few changes to this easy recipe. I couldn&apos;t find fresh cranberries so I used dried ones instead. In making the filling I eliminated the nutmeg but added 1 C. chopped pecans plus 1 C. brandy to make up for not having the fresh fruit. The filling. pastry and icing all turned out great. Delicious outcome. Will be sending some of these to several friends in the USA and Canada.
5,Pretty straightforward....not difficult but really fun to make! I want to try the recipe with cinnamon instead of the cranberry-orange. I certainly will use this recipe again!
4,rising dough... smells delicious. later I will bake them I love the fresh orange zest smell... yummy. ruthie
5,no changes yes i&apos;ll make again
4,A bit of work but worth it for a holiday or special brunch.
4,I cut the recipe in half. I did not like the way the dough turned out. I seemed to be more like a bread dough. Otherwise it was a very good combination. Will definitely make again with a regular sweet roll dough recipe.
5,Love anything with cranberries during the holiday season.
3,I love the tart of the cranberries. Lot of work but good directions helped made the recpie easier. I wrapped them lightly in plastic wrap for the last proof.
5,I made these for company on New Year&apos;s Day and they were a hit! I added 1/4 cup packed brown sugar to the wet ingredients based on the review and used 1 egg. I loved the soft texture and taste!
5,Made some changes first I doubled the recipe. That makes 5 Belgium waffles. Second I substituted 3 eggs for the substitute (remember doubled). Third I substituted buttermilk for the water because if I&apos;m going to eat waffles why not? They tasted great! Heated up some real maple syrup and butter in a gravy boat and poured it on because again why not?
4,These were very good. I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar which sweetened them up a little. For me this recipe only made 2 belgian style waffles.
4,These were pretty good. I used 1 egg 1 cup normal flour and 1/4 cup brown sugar. This was the first time we used our waffle maker so I think I just need to figure out how to make them crisper.
4,These were good. I doubled the batch and added about 1/4 of applesauce to sweeten them just a bit. I served them with apple topping (2 apples sliced thinly about 3 tbsp brown sugar 1 tbsp maple syrup 1-2 tsp cinn cooked over medium heat till boiling then simmered on on low till apples were just soft). It was good and plenty sweet enough for me. I also tried a few with chocolate chips mixed in. They were AWESOME! Served those ones with hot maple syrup.
5,Delicious! I used substitutes of 1/2 cup unsifted flour and 1/2 cup Whole Wheat Flour I used 1 whole egg. I added 1 scoop Ground Flax Seed. I added 1/4 cup Brown Sugar. I doubled the cinnamon. I like this served with a little Maple Syrup and topped with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
5,These waffles were really tasty and make the house smell great too!
4,These are great with real maple syrup but if you&apos;re going to eat them plain you may want to add a little sweetener. I used Ener-G egg replacer and non hydrogenated margerine instead of butter to make them vegan.
3,I made these changes: substituted 1 egg substituted 1 cup flour (because I didn&apos;t have the other kinds) and I added 1/8 cup flour. This recipe made a very small amount- on a regular waffle iron about 6 whole waffles. It smelled good and the batter tasted good but the waffle iron process sucked all the goodness out of it- so these were OK tasting but not very gingerbready. I served these with icing (milk and powdered sugar) and that helped the un-sweet flavor these had.
5,"Nice breakfast casserole.  I wanted something simple for a work breakfast and this fit the bill.  Two things, though:  I thought this needed more crust, so I used two packages of crescent roll dough instead of one, and I didn&apos;t understand why it needed to chill overnight.  I didn&apos;t have the time to do that anyway, so I just baked.  It was almost gone by the end of the day, and I really enjoyed it, so I think it was a hit.  thanks for the recipe!"
5,Awesome! I will make this on Christmas morning yummy!
5,This turned out great. Made this for work - I did one sausage as written above and one veggie (sauteed garlic onions peppers and tomatoes). Read the review about adding 2 crescent roll packages. I split the difference and put in 1 1/2 packages in each pan and found that to be more than enough crust (any more and I feel it would have been too overwhelming). I put in about 2/3rd of the cheese in the recipe because it looked like alot but in retrospect I should have put in the full amount. I used the cheese pizza blend package that Kraft makes and it turned out well. People at work seem to really like it judging by the lack of leftovers. I served this with mixed berries and iced coffee for a complete breakfast.
5,This was very good and the work mates loved it. I added a half cup of diced sweet bell peppers. I sprinkled them on between the sausage and cheese step. I made it the night before work. After it cooled I cut them into 12 squares and refrigerated them for the next day. Microwaved at work to reheat. Perfect!
5,Great breakfast pizza! Family hit! I added sautéed red peppers and onions to the turkey sausage and eggs and I topped it w/ half bacon and half turkey bacon. I added salsa and jalapeño peppers to top my slice off and it was DELICIOUS.
5,awesome quick and easy recipe! great base recipe or great just as it is! if you&apos;re a crust lover like myself I would add in another 8 ounce crescent roll pack!
5,Solid basic recipe that always turns out delicious. Easy to customize to whatever your tastes may be. Always a great hit at a pot luck or makes enough to have breakfast throughout the week.
5,This was a huge hit for Christmas brunch with friends and family. Everyone raved about it! Here are a few tweaks I made to the original recipe: added two eggs a little more milk used 3/4 of the sausage and added 1/2 pkg cooked bacon added 3/4 cup diced red bell pepper sautéed with onions in a little of the sausage grease (I put this layer of peppers/onions on top of saus/bacon mix). It cooked in the maximum time shown in original recipe perfectly. Also delicious with pico de gallo and avocado on top! DELICIOUS!!! This one is a keeper!!
5,We cut this in half for the 3 of us and had leftovers to eat another day cooking in 8x8 pan. We did sauté an onion to add in. when cutting in half even 1 roll of crescents was too much even though we lined the bottom AND sides of our pan. Yummy and filling tho. Thanks for sharing. Did not have time to make the night before just cooked as directed when complete
2,Didn t have quite enough flavor. Maybe add a small layer of cream cheese between the crust and sausage?
3,"I loved the concept, but please make your own hollandaise.  I&apos;ve never tried the powdered mix, and whipped it up and it was not good to me--I couldn&apos;t bear pouring it over my hard work!  Use &apos;Blender Hollandaise&apos; from this site and you&apos;ll get much better results and taste.  The casserole was okay, I guess I just like a lot more &apos;stuff&apos; in my egg casseroles.  Maybe some hot pepper sauce in the egg mixture along with some kind of cheese.  I love regular eggs Benedict, and the right hollandaise makes this recipe."
5,"Delicious. I used egg beaters, skim milk, 100 calorie english muffins and used butter buds instead of margarine. It puffed up nicely and tasted great"
4,"This recipe is very easy and good.  I had ham instead of canadian bacon, cut to 1/2 inch dice.  I think I would use regular onion next time, the green onion was a little over powering for my taste."
5,"I have made the recipe many times for very large groups of people. Everyone always loves it. The only thing I changes was the layering. I did layer of all the english muffins, all the Canadian bacon then poured custard mixture over. This recipe also freezes (after baked) and reheats well."
5,"had overnight guests and they loved it! We have learned that we detest all packaged hollandaise sauces EXCEPT Knorr Brand Hollandaise and we usually add a teaspoon or two of fresh lemon juice to it if we have lemons in the house. (I tried making hollandaise from scratch and actually PREFER the Knorr stuff. Crazy huh?) One thing we always include in our eggs benedict is steamed broccoli florets. Steamed the broccoli for about 5 minutes, sprinkled it with a little garlic salt and lemon pepper before adding to the casserole. Served that yummy sauce on the side. I must not have done a very good job with the cooking spray because I did have some trouble with sticking. So it isn&apos;t our beloved eggs benedict that we will always consider quite special but what it is we enjoyed very much and it freed me up to relax and visit with our guests! Tasty with hash browns, chilled canned pears and maybe even a bloody mary! YUM!"
5,very good. I doubled recipe and cooked for Sunday School Teachers meeting. Had several come back for seconds.
5,"Just served this for Christmas morning breakfast. The immediate comments were that it looked so beautiful. Someone said it looked like a picture out of a magazine. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe. I would not ""ruin"" it by adding cheese to it as some reviewers have suggested. Let the hollandaise sauce shine thru for something special and different. The ONLY suggestion I would make for improving it would be to make homemade hollandaise sauce---it is just that much better than the packaged variety and is not much more difficult than making the packaged kind (both you have to whisk it and watch it carefully on the stove as it thickens). So the packaged variety doesn&apos;t really save you that much work."
5,5 stars for the idea alone (for anyone that loves eggs bene)! I added some diced potato/onion used diced deli ham (always on hand) added garlic salt and shredded cheese blend before pouring on the eggs. Note that after adding the eggs....proportions didn&apos;t look right and I was worried I&apos;d have a top-half crunchy casserole but after baking it was perfect. Then discovered....and couldn&apos;t believe....that my hollandaise sauce was gone! Had to whip up a country gravy...thereby ruining the benedict effect...but next time...hollandaise all around please! Good with the changes I had to make...good place to start with ANY of your breakfast-favorite add-ins. I&apos;m sure it&apos;ll be even better with the right sauce!
4,Made this for Christmas breakfast buffet and everyone enjoyed it as written. Then for Christmas breakfast at home changed it up a bit. Used a pound of bacon fried and chopped in place of the Canadian bacon. Used 5 green onions replaced onion powder and salt with 1-1/2 tsp of onion salt and added fairly generous dashes of black pepper. When finishing used real butter instead of margarine and added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to the hollandaise sauce before pouring it over the casserole. We liked it even better this way and hash browns and orange juice made this complete. Another tip for leftovers - serve hollandaise sauce on the side so everyone can add the amount they want and then put remainder in frig with main casserole leftovers. When reheating heat separately and both will seem fresher than if refrigerated and heated as one dish.
5,"These are great potato pancakes aka Latkas.  I used 4 large russet potatoes, about 2 pounds. Water and starch are the enemy of crispy potatoes - here are a couple of tips.  Peel and place the potatoes in cold water.   I grate the potatoes and onion using the grater attachment on the food processor.  Then back into cold water in the basket of a salad spinner.  Rinse well and change the water a few times to remove the starch.  Once the water is almost clear, let soak completely covered in cold water in the basket of the salad spinner.  Whisk the eggs, flour, salt pepper together.  Drain the potatoes and spin them dry, empty the water out of the salad spinner bowl - shake the potatoes and spin them again.  Mix the dried potatoes with the egg mixture - it will appear as if there is not quite enough egg mixture but don&apos;t worry, there is plenty.  Use tongs or a slotted spoon to scoop the potatoes out and into the hot oil.  Do NOT move the patties until the edges are crispy.  Flip and continue cooking over medium heat until golden brown.  Heat you oven to 170 degrees and place the potato pancakes on a paper towel lined sheet pan in the warm oven to hold while you make the next batch.  If you don&apos;t have a salad spinner, Chef John&apos;s method of squeezing and drying with paper towels works OK or use a clean thin cotton dish towel and wring them out with that."
5,and if all else fails grab your waffle iron and a bag of tater tots. Spray with Pam lay them out and close the waffle iron. Cook about 10 min. Amazing crunchy and pretty too.....
5,Fantastic recipe. Put in the proper time & effort to squeeze as much of the moisture out as you can - you will be super impressed with the results! 5 stars.
4,My family recipe for potato pancakes/latkes uses the potato starch. I use a clean dish towel and put half of the onion potato mixture in it and twist the towel over a bowl of cold water. After squeezing all of the water out over the bowl you will note a layer of white starch has settled to the bottom on the cold water. Carefully pour the water off and add the starch layer back into the onion/potato mixture. This pure starch will act as a binder to hold the mixture together during the frying process of the pancakes. Chef John makes the point of instructing you to remove as much water as possible and that it the key to light crispy pancakes. To not remove the water results in soggy latkes that are gut bombs.
5,3/15: very good followed exactly except much less onion. 12/16 update: 5 lbs yukon gold so doubled the other ingredients except onion. use shredding blade of cuisinart. soak shreds in water 30 min wring dry with salad spinner and paper towels. I added some matzo meal because they weren&apos;t staying together well.
5,Thanks Chef John. So happy to see an authentic recipe for potato pancakes. My Polish mom made these every Friday for dinner and I make them at least once a month for my family. Wonderfully crisp tender and flavorful pancakes; try them topped with applesauce and or sour cream with chives. Just make lots and lots.
5,I&apos;m a 63 yr. old novice cook. I followed the recipe exactly to the best of my very limited ability and it turned out great. My grandmother made these a lot when I was a kid and these were as good as I remember hers to be. Thanks John. I&apos;ve used several of your recipes and you&apos;ve helped me gain a lot of confidence in cooking.
5,That&apos;s how it&apos;s done! Follow these simple instructions for perfect potato pancakes every time.
1,though very tasty these are just way way way to greasy... I used a lot of kitchen paper to soak up the oil and it still was too greasy to eat! I don&apos;t know if I did something wrong or not...
5,"I am the submitter to this recipe. No need to line your cookie sheet. Allrecipes did not include that you must use a cookie sheet with raised edges, make sure it is THICK sliced bacon, the thin will burn too quickly and to be very cautious when taking the bacon out of the oven. I usually drain mine before TURNING it after 7 minutes. I hope that this helps. Enjoy!"
5,"This method of cooking bacon when you&apos;re either cooking a big breakfast or when you&apos;re making a lot of bacon is like having a kitchen assistant! More important, it turns out beautifully. However, I always use an oven temperature of 400 degrees, and find it takes 15-20 minutes. I&apos;ve heard of brushing the bacon with maple syrup or sprinkling on brown sugar during the last few minutes of baking, but I&apos;ve never tried that. Thanks for passing this easy cooking method along to others."
5,"I have been doing this for years as I learned it in a restaurant I worked at. I line my baking sheet with foil. I didn&apos;t see any one mention this tip: Lay a sheet of foil over the top loosely to prevent spattering all over your oven! Remove top foil about 5 minutes before its finished baking for final crisping(I pour off the excess grease at this point,too.)"
5,I will not use a frying pan ever again after using this method! I always place my cooling rack over my sheet pan and place the bacon on top. That way the grease drips through the rack and my bacon comes out crispy every time.
5,This is how I cook my bacon only I don&apos;t use thick sliced and I put my oven at 425 because it gets crispier...and I find turning it once helps both sides to be crispy....It&apos;s easy and you can just throw away the foil....
5,"Wow. I am excited about this recipe! I love bacon and usually make it every weekend. If I&apos;m pressed for time I&apos;ll do it in the micro but that is not as good. This morning I decided to try this recipe. Since it was just me (the cat had a piece too and she loved it) I only made a few pieces so I decided to make it in the toaster oven. I don&apos;t think 350 is high enough, so I did 450 for 10 minutes, then flipped it and cooked it for a few minutes more. It was perfect!! Crispy, flat and evenly cooked. Plus, cleanup was a snap (I used a sheet with edges). It was even easier to pour the bacon grease into my glass dish I save the grease in!! I don&apos;t know that I&apos;ll ever fry bacon again. One other great thing about making it this way is no odor lingers. Great recipe. Even if you&apos;re not baking for a crowd. By the way, you don&apos;t HAVE to use thick cut bacon. In fact, I used the lean Oscar Meyer Center cut. TRY THIS!!! Oh, and for a special treat sometime, when the bacon is almost done sprinkle it with a little brown sugar and a dash (just a dash) of cinnamon. This is also fantastic if you baste with just a little bit of maple syrup. Wow! Told you I&apos;m excited about this recipe!!:))"
5,"Great idea!  So simple a caveman could do it  : ).  One extra thing that I do is save all that grease, pour it into a 8x8 cake pan lined with aluminum foil, mix in some corn meal and sunflower seeds.  Once it becomes firm you can cut it into four 4"" squares and you have suet cakes for our fine feathered friends.  Everyone benefits!"
5,"I love bacon, but I hate frying it on the stovetop.  For myself, I generally nuke it to reduce some grease/fat, but DH is not a big fan of nuked bacon.  I&apos;m so glad I stumbled across this ""recipe"" (more an alternative cooking method, than recipe).  So simple.  I place a wire rack in/on a cookie sheet and lay the bacon on top so the grease drips below.  I can only fit 6 pieces of bacon per cookie sheet (not touching...could prob squeeze 10).  I do not drain or flip, just bake at 400 for about 10-15 minutes for flat perfectly crispy bacon."
5,Thank you for a great way of cooking a bunch of bacon! I tried this on top of my broiler pan to let the fat drain off and I tried it as written. It is much better and cooks much faster as written! This is my new way of cooking bacon!
3,this is good but i like to sprinkle brown sugar. makes it even better!!!
5,I thought it was good but we used two big candy canes insted of four small ones so it was really sweet.You also need to crush them up really really good or else it has big chunks in it so you need to kind of turn it into dust. my whole family liked it even the kid who wont eat any thing!We drank it on new years eve.
5,Wow we really liked this! It was so easy to make. We didn&apos;t have candycanes - we crushed 8 round Starlight mints in place of the candycanes. We put them in a sealed plastic bag and placed it on our cutting board to make breaking the mints up easy. We just smashed the bag with a hammer. We topped the cocoa off with the swirly whipped cream from a can and it looked and tasted like something straight from Starbuck&apos;s. We&apos;re going to make this one an annual tradition.
5,This was a great treat! My family also enjoyed this while decorating the tree this year. I added red colored sugar sprinkles to the top of the whipped cream. It was very attractive looking and the kids went crazy! We loved it!
4,Strong chocolate flavor but the peppermint flavor was very subtle.
5,i made it with instant hot chocolate and crushed the hook off of a candy cane and then stuck the rest of the candy cane in the drink and it tasted great!
3,A nice change from the old standard but not spectacular. Make sure you use whole milk -- I tried to get by with the skim milk I had on hand and it just wasn&apos;t quite right.
5,Oh wow is all I can say! I crave this not only during the holidays now. Very easy to make. I used nutri-sweet calorie reduced instead of regular whipped topping and no one even noticed the difference. For someone who isnt into sweet things this might have a little too much flavour for them so just serve half a cup.
5,This was great my family drank it on new years eve!
5,Just suited for a cold winter day.Quite tasty indeed!
5,"I’ve used this recipe for the last several years for our traditional New Year’s Day panettone French toast.  It’s perfect.  But we cook way more than one slice at a time!  For 1/2 of a large panettone, I quadrupled the recipe (1 cup milk, 4 eggs, and a generous shake or two of cinnamon).  I used an electric griddle and found that 300 degrees worked well.  (375 degrees made it too brown/burned while the middle was still soggy.)"
5,Yummy! I like to melt the butter in the syrup and pour over toast keeping it nice and warm.
5,Perfect!!
5,Simple and very very good. A great use for all that Christmas Panettone.
5,Yummy. Thanks
5,Very easy and delicious! Will make again for sure.
5,"Great recipe!  Resulted in a rich, creamy egg dish.  I was the only one eating so I scaled this down to one serving and baked it in a large ramekin.  I did add a little garlic powder, paprika, and black pepper.  Next time will also add some cheese to the egg mixture.  This would also hold up to other mix-ins, like sausage pieces or veggies.  Yum!"
4,"Pretty as a picture, whether it’s in or out of the individual (10-oz.) ramekins I baked this in. (These unmold VERY easily)   Baked as an omelet makes the same old scrambled eggs look just a little more special.  And just as with any omelet or scrambled eggs, there’s a lot of flexibility to make this “your own,” or to make use of whatever meats, cheese or vegetables you have on hand.  In this case I used Canadian bacon, finely chopped bell peppers, onions and the cheese of course!"
5,"I love this recipe, I&apos;ve made it every day for breakfast for the past 4 days or so. I had to scale it way down and used 2 eggs, just 1 tsp of sour cream, and 1/2 tbsp to coat the dish, but it came out perfectly. I also tried cooking it at 375 degrees and the cheese came out all nice and golden, so if you prefer it that way, I would definitely say give it a shot. Also, be sure not to use too much butter to line the dish that you&apos;re cooking it in or else it all pools at the bottom when it comes out of the oven."
5,This made a wonderful dinner on a busy night after work. Served it with fruit salad. Adding to my recipe box.
5,Easy and delicious recipe as is but this time I added tomatoes bacon spinach and chives.
5,"Just the idea I was looking for but downsized it for the two of us. Used a 5"" baking dish for each portion with butter flavor baking spray and baked in my toaster oven at 325. Used only 5 eggs added grn & red pepper to veggies and some crumbled bacon (instead of ham). Cut back on the milk accordingly and added 2 Tbls ranch dressing instead of sour cream. Also added some salsa to mine; and omitted the cheese on his (he added catsup). Customized for our tastes!"
5,This was very good. I did add a little garlic powder and onion powder because I didn&apos;t have any green onions. I mixed in a bag of frozen broccoli which I microwaved first. It wasn&apos;t near done by 30 min (most likely because of the broccoli) so I ended up baking for almost 50 min.
5,"This recipe was easy and delicious! I have had some epic fails with other recipes on this site, but this one was a breeze and turned out great! I used a small casserole dish for the eggs so I had to extend the cook time (but covered it with foil midway through to prevent the top from drying out) and it turned out light, fluffy, and delicious! We had company over and everyone loved it - even the kids!!"
4,"4.5 stars for a tasty (modified) recipe! Decided to make amendments based on other egg dishes made previously. Love to do a stovetop omelet in a bag as well as fritattas of all types. Always halve a recipe (for two of us) when making the first time just in case it doesn&apos;t pass muster so we don&apos;t waste anything. Worked nicely in an 8"" skillet baked about 20 mins. Sounded a tad bland so chose to saute bacon in the skillet first. After removal sauteed chopped onion tomatoes and jarred roasted red peppers in the same skillet with the bacon grease. Terrific! Added a dash of hot sauce to the eggs and also substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream (a norm for me). Yes a bit time consuming but worth the effort and will make it again. Thanks Sarigal!"
2,Very simple but lacks flavor and is very dry.
4,"Very nice. I had some eggnog that was getting over the hill and wanted to use it up. This looked like a wonderfully different and elegant recipe. I added 1/4 tsp. ground nutmeg to help bring out the eggnog flavor (and because I love nutmeg). I ended up adding more eggnog to make the dough stick together. I made an eggnog-rum glaze to drizzle on top: I combined 1 1/2 Tbsp. melted butter, 1 tsp. corn syrup, 1/2 tsp. rum flavoring, 3/4 cup confectioners&apos; sugar and 2 Tbsp. eggnog (add more or less eggnog to get the correct drizzling consistency). I then just put the glaze in a baggie, snipped off the corner and drizzled in a zig-zag pattern, letting the glaze run over the edges of the scones. Delish! Especially served warm with a nice cup of tea."
5,These are delicious scones. I like the slight crunch that the cornmeal gives them. I baked it as one large round scone rather than cutting into smaller scones and just increased the baking time slightly. The eggnog flavour is very subtle so if you are looking for the eggnog flavour you might want to add some nutmeg.
5,This is a fast and delicious recipe that Hubby and I just love! Sometimes I substitute currants sometimes use plain milk instead of egg nog but they&apos;re always yummy!
4,Very easy recipe tasted really good. The eggnog taste is subtle not in your face. The round ones looked a little to perfect thought (like inexpensive canned biscuits) so I cut the second batch into triangles they looked much better that way. Im giving them as holiday gifts to friends.
5,Yum! I made these with the listed ingredients and they were great. Instead of making round scones I cut the patted out round into 8 wedges (personal preference for wedge shaped scones!). After reading comments about the eggnog flavor being very subtle I also brushed them with a little eggnog and sprinkled them lightly with sugar and freshly-grated nutmeg before baking... that little extra glaze adds a lot!
5,"Delicious! I had some eggnog to use up so off to Allrecipes I went (thank you AR for your ""search by ingredient"" feature!) and found this gem. Like other reviewers I added a splash or two more eggnog to get the dough to be not too crumbly. My husband made a glaze with orange juice triple sec orange extract and powdered sugar... with the glaze these scones are even more amazing. I&apos;ll definitely be making them again."
5,"These were a huge hit at a brunch I hosted. I kept them warm by using a warming plate, and the next time I might take one viewers suggestion and add a few eggnog spices for that extra flavor. Thanks!"
5,I halved the recipe and used corn muffin mix rather than just cornmeal. These were simple to make (once I got past rubbing in the butter. I&apos;m a bit of a novice at pastries.) and turned out wonderfully. The flavor is light they&apos;re not too dry and certainly not tough. Will make again. Thank you for sharing.
5,These were fabulous! Easy to make and even BETTER to eat. Mmmmmmm....
3,These were fine. No one else really liked them. I was trying to use up Christmas eggnog. I probably wont make them again. Cornmeal kind of made them grainy. You could tell cornmeal was in there.
5,"yum! I added freshly ground nutmeg, only 1 t cinnamon, and 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice. I sprayed a 9x13 baking dish with baking spray, packed bread slices in the pan and poured the batter over the whole thing. Covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated it overnight. This morning I took it out for an hour (Letting my glass baking dish come up to room temperature) then baked the french toast for 40 min. in a 350*F oven...divine! We didn&apos;t even use syrup, the eggnog taste was so yummy!"
5,"Yum!
                                
                                I used cheap white bread in this recipe
                                instead of french bread. When I made 
                                the egg mix, I used the leftover homemade eggnog that I had in the fridge.
                                I didn&apos;t use pumpkin pie spice, I used
                                more nutmeg and added a tsp. of rum flavoring.
                                
                                Really good. I&apos;ll make this again for sure."
5,My husband 2 yr. old and I loved this recipe. I think next time I will cut back a little on the cinnamon as I thought it overpowered the eggnog flavor a little.
5,"I made this for Christmas morning and everyone really liked it!  I read through a lot of the reviews and did adopt several alterations:  I used 4 eggs and about 1 cup of eggnog, used nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice.  Like several others, I made it the night before: put the bread in a 9 x 12 pan and poured the egg mixture over all.  Refrigerated overnight, covered in foil, then put in a 375 oven for about 35 min, til nicely browned.  So easy and delicious; I can see this becoming a new Christmas morning tradition!"
5,I modified this recipe a little (less cinnamon added sugar) and decided to try the suggestion to soak the bread overnight for more flavor. I don&apos;t have anything that holds 12 pieces of bread flat (does anyone?) so I stacked the bread in a plastic container with a lid and poured the mixture in between and on top but ran out at the end. In order to try to soak all the pieces I flipped the container a couple times. There must be a better way because the next morning the pieces were so soaked that they were hard to get on the griddle in bread-shaped pieces. If someone else has a different way let us know. Otherwise stick to the standard dip-and-grill method.
5,I saw Eggnog French Toast on a restaurant menu and thought I can make this at home.....logged onto All Recipes and found this fabulous recipe and made it for dinner one evening last week!! I am making it for Christmas day breakfast. I added 1TBL sugar to sweeten it up a bit.
5,Instead of pumpkin pie spice I just bought Pumpkin Spice Eggnog. I used whole grain white bread rather than French. My family loved this! It&apos;s a nice change of pace and perfect for the holidays.
4,I had to change the recipe as it is the toast gets too soggy. I use 4 eggs and 1 cup egg nog then just nutmeg dashed in before I dip each one because the spice just floats on the top and is gone after a few slices are dipped. We always use Kings Hawaiian bread sliced thick. Dip the bread quickly and then cook immediatly. Tastes great with blueberry syrup too.
5,I read the reviews and made some changes that I thought made it wonderful. First I used 6 slices of Texas Toast. Since it&apos;s so thick I used 4 eggs and 3 cups of eggnog. I used Trika G.&apos;s spices (Ground nutmeg- 1/2 tsp. 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice) and let it sit for about 1.5 hours since I didn&apos;t want the bread to be too soggy. Then I placed it on a foil covered baking sheet sprayed itcooking spray and baked it at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes flipping halfway through. The French toast gets fluffy and was not soggy in the least!
1,The eggnog to egg ratio in this recipe is waaaaaayyyyyyy off. My bread was mushy after 20min on the griddle. You actually need like 6 eggs with only a 1/2 cup eggnog for about 6 pieces of bread.
5,"I have been making cinnamon rolls for almost 40 years.  I always used the same recipe up until today.  This recipe is the best batch of cinnamon rolls I have ever made!  Family and friends all agreed!
                                I was looking for something that would use the yeast I had left over from Christmas.  I was intrigued that this recipe called for 
                                2 TBS of yeast.  If you are wondering how many packets that would be
                                1 packet = 2¼ tsp
                                2 Tbsp = 6 tsp.
                                You will need 2 whole packets PLUS 1½ tsp. out of a third packet.   A lot of yeast but well worth it.   I did reduce the brown sugar slightly as a personal preference.  The recipe called 1/4 tsp of salt in the caramel topping.  However I did not put the salt in the caramel instead I sprinkled sea salt in the prepared pans.  It gave the sweet caramel just the perfect taste of the the saltiness I have learned to love in my salted caramel candies.  Enjoy!!!!"
5,"I love this site, used tons of recipes-almost always with great results- yet I&apos;ve never felt compelled to post a review, but these buns are utterly amazing. I bake weekly and have for years but never have I made anything quite so perfectly delicious in every way. You must try these..the brown sugar caramel,the salted pecans, the fragrant cinnamon,  the tender yeast bread...each lovely, but the combination is breath-taking. Seriously. I tried to add a picture but it seemed to be sideways, nevertheless, try these rolls..."
5,We really enjoyed this sticky buns! My husband brought them to work and there were none left on his return! I ended up having to add a cup and half of flour to get the right texture. Because of this I wish I would have doubled the filling and caramel recipe and made 3 plates instead of 2. OTHERWISE Amazing! I&apos;ll make again! Thank you Diamond Crystal!
5,THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I have made A LOT of cinnamon rolls in my life but I wanted to try the salted carmel sauce with pecans. Boy am I glad I did. This is my &apos;go to&apos; recipe from now on and I&apos;ll pass this recipe onto future generations. (Note: I needed to put foil on the lower shelf of the oven as my pans bubbled over with goodness:) Be sure to tip the pans onto a plate IMMEDIATELY out of the oven as the sauce cools very quickly.
5,I made these just as described except that I have a convection oven so I had to bake them for only 20 minutes. They were a huge success. In fact I was only planning to make a half batch but forgot and made 2 pans and was glad I did since one pan disappeared in less than an hour. Wonderful!
5,So good so sweet. This was a great recipe. I added a sprinkle of salt on top of the sticky buns to cut the sweetness a bit but it was a great Sunday treat. Really good hot so microwave if necessary.
5,This was indeed delicious!!! I was lazy and didn&apos;t feel like making the dough since I had a leftover frozen loaf of Brigford&apos;s dough. I used the one loaf and split the recipe in half for the sauce and filling. I didn&apos;t have any heavy cream so I used a substitute of milk and butter I found on line. Probably could have skipped that since I only needed 1 1/2 tbsp. I would definitely make this again!! YUM!
5,Great recipe! I made it almost exactly as stated (minus nuts) but I made the dough the night before and let it rise for 30 minutes. I then made the caramel and rolls to go in the fridge. I pulled them out early in the morning and let them rise for about 75 minutes before cooking in the convection oven for 24 minutes. Wow they were fantastic!
5,Took to work. Everyone loved them and I was told they wanted me to make them again for our next get together.
3,Must&apos;ve done something wrong the bread texture was almost crumbly. I didnt have cream so I used sweetened evap and it was pretty yummy but not as drippy gooey as I&apos;d have hoped. going to try again with fresh flour. I think it&apos;s probably a perfect recipe tried by an imperfect baker lol! Thanks
5,"Substituted red pepper flakes for the Aleppo. My wife finished hers before I could sit down! Very tasty!
                                Thanks Chef John!"
5,I used pita bread as Chef John commanded.
5,This might be the best thing I have ever made. I had all the ingredients including Aleppo pepper so it was a no brainer when I saw this video. I absolutely demolished the plate. WOW is this good. Thank you Chef John!!
5,Didn&apos;t have fresh garlic- the pungency of fresh garlic (rather than powdered or pre-chopped) would have made this even better. Worth it to use Aleppo peppers- find them at your local Mediterranean store. Till next time!
5,Really lovely I added tarragon to the yogurt as well it was so yummy
5,Made without the optional parsley and jalapeno oil and just used regular crushed red pepper. Excellent. I made sure to warm the plate before assembly and made naan for dipping.
5,This is really outstanding and I think both oils are worthwhile. My only note would be to leave plating until the eggs are cooked and draining on paper towel--otherwise the yogurt and oils kind of coalesce into one circular blob on the plate. Having everything at room temp is pretty crucial to get the flavors to meld and lines up with how this dish would likely be served traditionally.
5,I love this recipe! I&apos;ve made this several times and it is amazing every time.
5,Simply amazing flavors! My new favorite breakfast!
5,OMGoodness!   Yum
5,"I haven&apos;t tried this yet, but it&apos;s brilliant! I never thought of using the air fryer to do this"
5,This is so easy and is always such a hit! Tip: Warm the Nutella in the microwave for 15-20 seconds before spreading -- otherwise it&apos;s difficult to spread evenly.
5,A friend made this the other day for an afternoon tea break and we gobbled it up. It was delicious! So I went and bought puff pastry and nutella (actually the store brand) and just made two trees this afternoon. So quick and easy that I didn&apos;t even need to refer to the recipe. If I had I might have remembered the egg wash--but even without it came out beautifully. Hint--zap the nutella jar for 10 seconds so it spreads easily. Go ahead and just slather one entire sheet of puff pastrywith nutella on a piece of parchment on a cookie sheet. Ease the top pastry on. Then cut the center triangle. Use the two half side triangles to make a second tree. Seal the two sides together on top with fingers dipped in water. This is a new family favorite!
5,Added a dried cherry to the end of each branch to hold it down. This added a festive and flavorful touch.
5,"this was a christmas dessert hit this year. i&apos;d never made it before but it&apos;s SO easy! i decorated it with some red and green m&m&apos;s just sprinkled here and there. my family loved it. a little light and a little sweet it didn&apos;t make anyone feel ""stuffed."""
4,Made this with peanut butter and chocolate chips. Sprinkled powder sugar on once done. Good but needed a little bit more sweetness. Going to do a hame and cheese version next.
5,Not a fan of Nutella. Would jam or other filling work as well.
5,This was so easy! However I cooked down fresh strawberries with a tbs of sugar and used it for filling. I also spread cream cheese on the dough before adding the strawberries. Yum! Next time I may drizzle melted dark chocolate over it!
5,Relatively simple. Family loved it! Will make again for Christmas morning
5,This is deceptively easy! Read up about how to handle puff pastry if you are unfamiliar before starting as it would be a shame to crack your pastry sheet. I used the two excess triangles from the sides to create two smaller herbed cream cheese trees made in a similar fashion and those were so delicious! This is best served right out the oven. I brought it to a party and it fared okay but ideally right out of the oven would be best. Now i am thinking of all the combos pesto/ricotta ham/cheese chorizo/cilantro. So so simple and delicious.
3,A bit messy when twisting the tree branches. No need to sugar on top.
5,"These turned out great! I&apos;ve never had much success with homemade hashbrowns, always because I have just tried frying up plain grated potatoes, and I thought I would look for an actual recipe that might yield something a bit more restaurant-quality. This recipe is definetly it! They weren&apos;t greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add my salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hashbrowns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices, etc. Highly recommended!!!"
4,Great recipe...for those who detest frying like i do..I sprayed my grill with some PAM and cooked them for about 10-15 minutes..they were still crispy and not greasy at all! Added extra spices as well..yummy.
5,"Wow.  Unbelievable.  About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside.  And what a flavor.  This will be my hashbrown recipe from here on out.
                                
                                I do have one cautionary tip, particularly if like me, you haven&apos;t cooked hashbrowns before.  Make sure that you don&apos;t have too much oil in the pan.  The hashbrowns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste."
5,"This is a great versatile recipe. I used sweet potatoes instead of russetts and flavored them with salt, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ground clove. Really delicious. If you have a food processor you can shred the potato and they will keep in the freezer until ready for use."
5,"This recipe was fantastic!  The hash browns were golden and crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  
                                
                                My girlfriend said she felt like hash browns with bacon and onions in them so I used this recipe as my starting point.  First, I pan-fryed 6 bacon strips until crispy (next time I will use at least 8).  Then I broke up the bacon into tiny pieces and added them into the mix with the other ingredients along with 1/2 red onion chopped, sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Also, i made little hash brown patties rather than covering the whole pan.  They really turned out nice."
5,"Isn&apos;t it great when you can create something in the kitchen using simple ingredients. Here&apos;s a few ideas of playing around with an already excellent recipe. 1. Where the recipe calls for squeezing the liquid out of the shredded potatoes... it REALLY means it. Make sure all the liquid is gone. You might place the shredded potatoes in the middle of a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth, form into a small pouch, and squeeze. 2. If you&apos;re looking for a way to reduce the oil, here&apos;s a trick. Go to a local cooking store, and purchase an oil mister. Then pick up a bottle of grape seed oil (make sure it&apos;s unflavored). Grape seed oil will not impart any additional flavor to the dish, and it has a high smoke point. Fill the mister with the oil (a mister is like a refillable spray bottle). Now, get the hash browns ready for cooking. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat, and then use the mister to spray the surface of the pan, and finally add a half tablespoon of sweet butter. Cook the hash browns until the outer surface is crispy, but not burned (about 5 minutes per side). They will taste great... without all that oil. You might want to sprinkle some finely grated cheddar or harvarti cheese over the top... up to you, and your guests. Serve while still nice and hot. They will be crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Keep the faith, and keep cooking."
5,"My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp cheddar, a little garlic powder,dash of oregano and some green onions. Extra virgin olive oil to fry in, about a quarter cup. Will keep this recipe and use over and over. Always trying a little something different."
5,"Thank you, Emily!  I&apos;ve never had success with hash browns and those were wonderful.  I used two skillets; one with a thick layer and another with just a thin layer.  They were both great.  I didn&apos;t use nearly as much oil as the recipe called for and will use even less next time."
2,"I thought it was weird that this recipe has so many different reviews, but this just wasn&apos;t good to us.  I thought the flour and egg were fine (used less flour than recipe), but it was the oil.  After the hash browns sat out on the paper towel they were still very oily.  Maybe we will try MISSCATIAS suggestion of cooking them with no oil."
5,"Changed recipe for simplicity: 2 1/2 Cup Aunt Jemima Original Pancake Mix, 3 TBS brown sugar, 2 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 egg, 1 3/4 cup milk, 2 TBS vegetable oil, 2 TBS vinegar, 1 cup pumpkin puree. These were fantastic!"
5,"I love this recipe; it&apos;s a hearty, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast. The following are a couple tips for the best pancakes. Don&apos;t thin the batter with more milk. This washes out the pumpkin flavor. Instead, the batter should be portioned out with a 1/4 c. measure onto a moderately hot griddle; then the batter should be spread out slightly using a spoon or a small spatula. This creates the fluffy texture while keeping them hearty. Second, I used a food processor to mix up the wet ingredients. This makes a smoother batter as it breaks down the fiberous pumpkin. The result is a lighter pancake with a more pronounced pumpkin flavor. Third, I used a fresh, good quality pumpkin pie spice rather than measuring out the individual spices; this is an easier preparation, and the flavors were fresher  (I get my pumpkin pie spice from a local spice shop that grinds and mixes it weekly for the best quality). Fourth, I got the best results either using whole milk or evaporated milk. Low-fat and fat free milk products just left the flavor dull."
3,"With a little tweeking, this recipe is fantastic.  I&apos;ve been modifying this recipe for quite some time to perfect it.  I thought the pumpkin taste was too weak originally, and it lacked a true ""pumpkin recipe flavor"" without nutmeg.  Also, the cinnamon flavor was not noticeable.  Here are my suggestions:
                                
                                1.  Add 1 1/3 cups pumpkin
                                2.  Add 1 Tbsp Cinnamon
                                3.  Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg
                                4.  Delete the allspice, vinegar and ginger
                                
                                Here are my ingredients:
                                2 cups all-purpose flour
                                3 tablespoons brown sugar
                                2 teaspoons baking powder
                                1 teaspoon baking soda
                                1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
                                ½ teaspoon nutmeg	1/2 teaspoon salt
                                1 1/2 cups milk
                                1 1/3 cups pumpkin puree
                                1 egg
                                2 tablespoons vegetable oil
                                
                                It makes a nice dense pumpkiny flavor pancake that is fantastic with any decent syrup.  I&apos;ve made it several times and get rave reviews always."
5,"We ate Pumpkin pancakes at the restaurant, IHOP, last winter.  I have searched for recipes to try and duplicate the pancakes...This recipe took the first place ribbon!  Thank you so much!   It was very good and my family enjoyed them very much!"
4,"As an old pancake/waffle baker I was eager to try this recipe.  I followed many suggestions in the reviews (2 eggs, 1 cup whole wheat PASTRY flour) and tweaked it even further.  My daughter had just eaten at a trendy breakfast cafe in Ashland, Oregon and claimed these were even better...lighter, etc.  Extra suggestions...add fresh nutmeg (1/2 t.), ground cloves (1 t.) increase cinnamon to 1 TABLESPOON and ground ginger to 2 teaspoons, brown sugar to 4 Tablespoons, ditto oil.  Also increase leavening to 2 TABLESPOONS ( I use only Rumford&apos;s and NO baking soda at all).  Finally, mix w. 1 plus cup of milk, let stand to absorb the dries and then add MORE milk to get that perfect pancake batter conistency.  Works well as waffles, also."
5,"These pancakes are OUT OF THIS WORLD! They&apos;re moist and delicious!
                                As always, I used REAL pumpkin instead of the canned stuff (I think it makes
                                a HUGE difference and real pumpkins are so easy to cook--I just cut them in 
                                half, scoop out the insides, and then put them face down on a baking sheet at
                                425 degrees for about an hour. After they cool, the skins come off very easily. 
                                Then take the pumpkin and mash it with a potato masher. Just make sure that
                                you use the right kind of pumpkins--sweet ones like New England or Baby Pam.
                                The big ones at the supermarket will not work).
                                Then I put butter REAL maple syrup on the pancakes, but they&apos;re so good, you 
                                could almost eat them plain! 5 stars!"
5,"AWESOME!!!  I start by making the recipe just as it calls to be made so that when I rate a recipe those who read the review know what the recipe might be like from my perspective if you make it LIKE THE RECIPE SAYS!!!  I know this might be a novel idea but please give it a try!!!!  I did have to add additional liquid as it was a bit too thick.  When I see a recipe calling for milk and vinegar, these two mixed together give you an emergency substitute for buttermilk.  Next time I will go ahead a use buttermilk!!!   To the person who used the pancake mix - do not rate recipes like this if you are not going to follow the recipe as you did not make this recipe at all!"
4,"I used an electric skillet on 300 degrees...if you follow the recipe completely your pancakes will come out great.  Adding water or more milk takes away from the flavor.  Once you place the batter on the skillet, just spread it out a little with the back of a spoon...that will help thin the pancakes out.  Great recipe for picky eaters!!"
5,My 2 year old has requested these pancakes on several occassions. For fluffier pancakes I add an extra egg. Most assuredly worth trying!
5,"What a wonderful dish!! I made this for dinner instead of breakfast, it turned out delicious, but I did make a few changes. First, I used a 9x13 glass dish, and used 1 1/2 lbs. hash browns that had diced pepper & onion in them, which added wonderful flavor, I highly recommend doing this. Second, I used 10 eggs instead of 5, which was perfect and doubled the milk. This was perfectly baked at one hour also. I used 8 ounces of Morningstar Farms vegetarian breakfast sausage sliced, and meat eaters could barely tell the difference! I will use this recipe often, and definitely make it again using regular sausage. Another tip, the last 3-4 minutes of baking, remove the foil and turn the broiler on, this really made the cheese nice. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I love it!"
5,"My whole family really loved this dish.  I made it on the spur of the moment, and changed a few things to use what I had on hand.  First, after reading the reviews here I decided to use a 9X13 inch baking dish.  It turned out to be the perfect size.  Since I only had 4 eggs, I just used those.  I added about 4 ounces of ricotta cheese to the eggs as well, and used a bit less milk than the recipe called for.  Also, I didn&apos;t have any sausage but did have a lot of leftover ham as well as a few slices of cooked bacon.  I sauteed the onions first, added some minced garlic, and finally tossed in the chopped ham and crumbled bacon to heat it through.  I then assembled the casserole as directed.  I only baked it for about 50 minutes total, and it was perfect.  A dollop of sour cream on top of each serving, and we loved it!  The leftovers heated up nicely for lunch the next day."
5,"I had this for breakfast today and it was great! I put it together the night before and just had to bake it this morning. I used shedded hash browns and cooked them before I put them in the dish. I also used fresh mushrooms and green pepper with onion that I sauted. My husband and son loved it. Thanks for the great recipe, I will make this again."
5,I toss the frozen hashbrowns with 3 tablespoons melted butter and bake in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  This eliminates the bland potato taste and improves the texture.  I don&apos;t add the onion or garlic powder at all because it makes it a little to savory for 8 am.  I even make the night before and bake the following morning with excellent results.  Delicious!!!
5,"MAKE THIS!!  I made it today for brunch for 7, using 6 eggs. I used cooked, crumbled bacon instead of sausage, and added sauteed onion, garlic and red & orange bell pepper.  I made a crust with the potatoes in a greased 9 x 13"" pan, drizzled them lightly with oil, and baked at 400 for 15 minutes before adding the egg mixture and finishing as directed.
                                Served with fresh fruit salad and fresh blueberry muffins. Everyone loved it!  No leftovers!"
5,"I make this recipe exactly as written and it comes out perfect every time and it&apos;s delicious! Sometimes I forget to even thaw the potatoes, I just let them thaw in the pan as the oven preheats. I think the problem many are having is that they are using the diced potatoes. Maybe it&apos;s a regional thing, but around here hash brown potatoes are shredded, diced potatoes will definitely be too dry and 2 pounds way too much for this! 2 pounds of shredded potatoes though compacts nicely on the bottom of the pan. I bet making this into a couple of quiches would be delicious too!"
4,"Just made this, but it is still in the oven cooking so can&apos;t attest to the taste.   However, I never could have fit this all into a 8 x 8 pan.  Had to use 2 8 x 8 pans for everything to fit in."
5,Delicious! I liked the idea of combining the potatoes and eggs into one dish. After reading some of the reviews I doubled all of the ingredients except for the hash browns and cheese. Since it was Easter I substituted the sausage for ham and bacon. Added minced onions 3 T melted butter 3 T bacon grease and seasonings to hash browns and baked for 30 minutes before adding the eggs and cheese. I added the the top layer of cheese the last 10 minutes of baking time to avoid it from becoming too overdone. I am sure this dish is just as wonderful with sausage. Great addition to my recipe collection!
5,"What an awesome recipe made even better by so many reviews with suggestions! First of all, I KNEW that I had to make this in a 13x9"" pan. No way does this fit in a 2-qt or 8x8 pan. I chose a stoneware-type so it would retain heat as long as possible as I needed to transport it. Using so many of your recommendations, I assembled it the night before, I pre-cooked the froz.potatoes w/3 Tbsp melted butter (Brummel&Brown in my case) for 30 mins.@400F, and cooled completely before layering.I used 4 eggs equiv. (i.e. 1 cup) of EggBeaters, 1/2C fat-free half&half, reduced-fat bulk pork sausage,a little leftover chopped ham (if I&apos;d had some bacon I&apos;d have added that, too), chopped peppers w/the onions, minced garlic, a splash of Frank&apos;s Red Hot Wings sauce, finely shredded reduced-fat Mexican style 4-cheese blend (I used a bit less than 12 oz. and it was fine), freshly ground peppercorns, salt, and kept everything else the same per original recipe. I put the refrigerated dish into the cold oven, then turned it on so it could gradually heat up, and started the 1 hr. from there. Plus just under the 10 mins. uncovered, it was cooked to perfection. NO leftovers. It was a hit. LOVE a recipe that can be tweaked in so many ways and come out great!"
3,I added more eggs as it seemed dry...everyone liked it.
5,"5 stars after several changes. Melted 1/4 cup butter in bottom of the pan 1st. Added 1/3 cup bisquick to the egg/milk mixture. Used homemade white bread (no crust) and mixed it into the egg mixture. Then poured the mixture over the melted butter. Baked at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Served it topped w/ syrup and homemade sweetened whipped cream.
                                One last thing, I dont appreciate the person who (just a few comments down) blasted people for commenting on ways in which they had to or wanted to change the recipe. FYI: some people dont always have all the exact ingredients on hand and have to improvise or sometimes they just change things because they feel like it; Nothing wrong with that! By stating these improvisations, they are helping other people who don&apos;t have all the exact ingredients on hand or helping the people who don&apos;t always want to follow recipes to the T. Once again, nothing wrong w/ that!"
4,"With some minor tweaking, I made this a ""keeper"".  Deleted the margarine, added 1 1/2 cups more bread, 1/4 c brown sugar, 3 oz cream cheese and 1/4 c pankcake syrup.  Also, doubled the cinnamon and added about 1 t nutmeg.  Mix the cream cheese with the eggs, one at a time.  Add in the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT the bread & mix well.  Then stir in the bread and pour the mixture into a prepared 9X15 pan and let sit for about 15 minutes.  (I used white sandwhich bread, lightly toasted.  If you&apos;re using a hard, dry bread, overnight would be best.)  Bake at 350 for about 20 minutes.  This came out perfect and my boys&apos; finicky taste buds LOVED it!  Additionally, I&apos;ve made this with cinnamon raisin bread. Ooohh, YUM!  A big hit at church!"
5,"haha! Now children please... I have been using this site for many years. I joined today because this discussion is so funny. Haven&apos;t made this recipe yet. May, may not. Looks like a 5 star to me though. Ok here are the facts: Reviewing a recipe which you have changed in not reviewing the recipe... I seldom follow a recipe exactly just because its the way I am. I like to play. The only way to review a recipe is to make it as its described and then rate it. If you change things the next time then say Its rated () as is but... I found it much better when I made it with ""these changes"". Or add a custom version to the custom version tab (should be obvious). Don&apos;t make changes and rate the recipe as you changed it because then its not the recipe we are evaluating and it isnt helpful to anyone and its then just an ego trip you are on. There is nothing wrong with suggesting alternatives that you like but its not fair to any of us if you rate anything other than the original... Sorry thats just the honest facts people. I do love to read about the alternatives don&apos;t get me wrong. I just don&apos;t like when a cook reviews the recipe based on those changes. By all means HAVE FUN and BE CREATIVE!!!! Haha.."
4,"It not out of the oven yet but it smells and looks wonderful!  
                                For the cook who doesn&apos;t like people experimenting........honey, that is the heart and soul of cooking!  I like the reviews because I can see what works and what doesn&apos;t and exchange ideas with other cooks.  
                                For the people who got soggy bread, try using larger chunks of bread and maybe a shallower pan like a large cookie sheet with sides.  
                                What I did:  eyeballed the eggs and milk, yep I like to live dangeriously! Mixed up the custard in a measuring cup using 3 eggs to start and eyeballing the milk and sugar, used cinnamon and nutmeg, vanilla and a shot of brandy for extra flavor.  Poured the custard over the bread in a bowl and mixed it with my hands to see how the dry/wet ratio was.  Needed more wet so mixed another egg with a little milk and there you go!  Placed it in a single layer in a greased pan, sprinkled on more sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg and drizzled with melted butter.  
                                This recipe is so versitle you could use egg nog in place of the milk for holidays or add cubes of cream cheese and or strawberry preserves for a stuffed french toast, even adding a little orange peel would change the flavor.  Be creative, have fun!"
5,"I made this on Christmas eve day and brought it to my family&apos;s brunch on Christmas. So easy, so delicious, this was a favorite of everyone! All my sisters wanted the recipe. Next year I&apos;ll make a double batch. This will be served at our Christmas brunch every year from now on!"
4,"This was really good, and unlike other reviewers; we didn&apos;t have a problem with the middle of the casserole being goopy (although I did bake it for longer than suggested; 60 minutes).  I changed the recipe only slightly, instead of adding 1 1/2 cups of milk, I added 1/2 cup of egg nog, about 1/4 cup of half and half cream (just to finish up what I had on hand), and topped it up with milk to equal 1 1/2 cups.  The egg nog gave this dish an excellent flavour, next time I will add 1 cup of egg nog and the rest milk or cream."
4,"Pretty good.  I had half a loaf of bread that was just about to go stale so I thought I&apos;d give this a try. I sprayed the bottom of my pan with Pam for baking and left out the margarine.  I added some nutmeg and a little more vanilla.  This took over an hour to bake.  But, even though it was a little mushy when I first cut it, I let it sit for about fifteen minutes (not intentional) and it firmed right up.  I sprinkled a little confectioners sugar on top and served it with butter and maple syrup.  It was even better the next day out of the microwave!"
5,Fabulous! Definitely a hit with the kids. I&apos;ve made this several times and it is so easy. A few times I have used the King&apos;s Hawaiian rolls and refrigerated overnight before cooking. YUMMY!
5,This recipe was great... we loved it. I used one raisin bagel as part of the 5 cups of bread. Because the bagel was denser bread the liquid required was perfect. I also used 1/4 cup of French Vanilla coffee creamer to thicken the milk and give it more of a vanilla flavor.
3,very good a different way to make french toast
5,Made this with Easter ham from a week ago. - Oh what to do with all that left over ham.  Made this and was skeptical. My family loved it - and they are very finikey. Yum! Clean plates - everyone loved it! Thank you. Didn&apos;t change a thing!
5,This was a very tasty and hearty meal!! I was looking for a recipe to use for leftover ham and this one is a keeper! It&apos;s quick and easy and my fiance loved it. The only thing I changed was that I added about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and some green beans. Thanks for the recipe! *Update* I had this next day and added salt to it and it was PERFECT! I thought the ham would be salty enough and didn&apos;t want to oversalt it...I was wrong. Add extra salt!
5,Ultimate decadent comfort food!  Too bad I only have leftover ham about twice/year!  This recipe is basically the same as my au gratin potato recipe with the exception of adding the ham and cubing instead of slicing the potatoes.  Also used a combo of sharp and extra-sharp cheddar cheese.  Thanks for sharing!
5,"Yum! Very tasty. I changed things up a little based on another au gratin potato recipe I&apos;ve made before. Used 4 T of flour and 2 C of milk to make a little more sauce. Used 2 C of shredded cheese and added salt, pepper, nutmeg, cayenne, and mustard to the sauce. Didn&apos;t feel like cooking anything ahead of time so layered the potatoes, onion, and ham raw in the pan and poured the sauce over it. Covered with foil and baked at 375 for 90 minutes. Excellent! Worth all the peeling and chopping."
4,"This was really good. I didn&apos;t boil the potatoes, I just cubed them and fried them in a skillet with some oil, diced onions, diced peppers, some garlic and a splash or two of chicken broth. Of course, I added salt and pepper to taste. Once the potatoes started to soften I mixed in the cubed ham. When it was done I put it in the casserole dish and topped it with the cheese sauce and breadcrumbs and popped it in the oven. The only thing I would do differently next time is omit the breadcrumbs. I didn&apos;t feel like they added anything to the dish and, in the 25 minutes the dish was in the oven, they didn&apos;t really brown. So, it was like I just had raw breadcrumbs on top soaking up the cheese sauce. Other than that I will surely be making this again. It was a great use for leftover ham and very yummy!"
5,We tried this last night and I wish I had taken a photo to post bc it looked great.  Slight changes just to speed it up.  We used 2 cans of canned diced potatoes and a can of peas.  It was delicious and very easy.  Great way to use leftover ham.  Worth a try. Thanks for posting!
5,"I made this with leftover ham and veges from thanksgiving dinner.  My husband is an avid casserole hater and he went back for seconds.  He said he really liked this! I added some celery, carrots, red and green peppers that were left over from our relish tray.  I boiled the celery and carrots with the potato and sautéed the peppers with the onion.  A very tasty one dish meal!  All I had for bread crumbs were Italian panko crumbs, but they added a nice flavor.  Enough left over for lunch tomorrow.  I will make this again."
5,This recipe was great and utilized a few things that would have gone bad if I didn&apos;t use them soon (namely ham and potatoes). The only thing I did differently was add a bit more flavor for fear of my toddler not liking it. She definitely loves her spices. I added a bit of garlic powder and chili powder to the ham and onions as they were cooking. And I sprinkled on crushed rosemary before the bread crumbs. My whole house smells like rosemary potatoes (YUM!) and the taste is phenomenal. Definitely making this one again.
4,I made this recipe with adding crushed red pepper as the only tweak. I found that 1/4 cup bread crumbs were quite generous. I added a picture.
3,"I thought this dish was OK, but nothing special.
                                I pretty much made it exactly as written, except that I bought ""new"" ham instead of using leftovers, and I shredded my own Cheddar from a large block. I should note that a 1.5-quart baking dish would not have sufficed for me. I only had a 2.5-quart dish, and it was nearly filled. (I think that maybe my ""small"" potatoes were larger than they should have been.) I thought the cheese sauce was nice, and I ate it all over several days, but it just wasn&apos;t exciting, sorry."
5,"This was excellent but the temperature of the oven worried me.  All other recipes for overnight French toast call for 30 to 45 minutes at 350 degrees.  Since 450 seemed very high, I baked at 450 for 15 minutes and lowered temp to 350 and baked another 30 minutes.  It was nice and crunchy on the outside and bread was NOT at all soggy. Great dish for company."
5,"This dish is amazing!! Everyone was full but couldn&apos;t stop eating it! The bonus is you can make it the day before and pop it in the oven just before serving. I used a sliced Italian crusty bread but it was too thin and not substantial enough so I&apos;ll stick to the crusty French loaf, sliced about 1"" thick, and day old for better absorption without getting mushy. Great recipe! You won&apos;t regret it! Lorraine"
3,"The bones of this recipe are great! The issue is the cooking instructions given. Cooking any type of egg bake over 375 is going to give you a half baked dish. I made the dish as the direction say (except I added extra cinnamon to the egg mixture as well as the top). I also added fresh blueberries prior to baking. I lowered the temperature to 350 and baked it for a full hour. The result was a delicious bread pudding/french toast casserole.
                                I hope this helps!"
5,"This was very easy to make and surprisingly delicious! I forgot to assemble the night before, so I made it in the morning and let it sit for about 90 min, checking every 15-20 min and pressing the top layer down to ensure it absorbed the egg mixture. I cooked for 35-40 min, and it puffed up tremendously. It was still a little wet in the middle, so next time I&apos;ll probably reduce the heat to 425 or 400 and cook for 45-50 min. Seriously good, and an impressive presentation for little work! EDIT: The caramel on the bottom can burn if left in too long, even as the top looks fine. Next time I&apos;ll stick with 35ish  min."
5,"this is delicious!  instead of preparing it in the pan the night before, I usually prepare it in a big bowl and leave it in the fridge overnight, stirring or shaking it whenever I walk by.  In the morning I make the brown sugar/butter sauce while the oven is warming up (takes about the same amount of time) and put the bread into the pan at that time.  it&apos;s really good - you don&apos;t need any syrup or anything!"
5,"Recipe Group Selection:  28, February 2015 ~ Loved it!  Of all the French toast casseroles I&apos;ve made, this one has been our favorite.  I made a half recipe and put it in a 7"" x 11"" pan.  Be sure to spray your baking dish with cooking spray as the caramel sauce on the bottom wants to stick to the pan.  The bread was cook all the way through and not the least bit mushy in the middle.  That is why we enjoyed this recipe so much.  I served this with scrambled egg whites, fresh oranges and the &apos;Absolute Best Pancake Syrup&apos; from AR.  It certainly didn&apos;t need the syrup, but it was delicious, none-the-less, on this breakfast treat that will be a repeat in our house."
5,"After reading all the reviews I made a few minor changes to avoid the sogginess and burning problems. Before placing it into the fridge for the night I mixed all the ingredients in the pan so the brown sugar/butter mixture was not just on the bottom of the pan but spread throughout the bread. This also helped make sure the egg mixture got to all sides of the bread. I used fresh challah and it looked very soggy but it all cooked well and puffed up nicely. I skipped the brown sugar on top and cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes.  It was perfect and so easy! If you&apos;re concerned about using eggs, I used egg beaters and couldn&apos;t tell the difference."
3,This was ok. The flavor was great but the overall sogginess needs to be addressed. Only the top was crisp and firm the innards were complete mush. I even dropped the temp to 350 and cooked for another 30 minutes trying to dry it out. Next time I will try cubing the bread a day ahead and let the bread dry out/get a little stale. Or maybe mixing it just ahead of the cooking. I don&apos;t know but the mush has got to go.
5,"Just tried it and didn&apos;t have a lot of time. Mixed everything the night before and put it in the oven in the morning while getting ready for work. 
                                My friends at work LOVED it so much I had to send them the recipe, WONDERFUL dish"
5,"This has become a weekend staple at our home. AMAZING BISCUITS!! I finally figured out how to freeze the un-cooked biscuits so now I always have them on hand, but only have to make them once a week.  FYI if you&apos;re interested... make the recipe as is, except don&apos;t brush them with the butter milk.  Instead put all the un-cook biscuits on a cookie sheet with parchment paper on the tray.  Cover well with plastic wrap and put in the freezer.  Once frozen solid, put into a zip bag and leave in the freezer.  When you want to eat them you can have as many or as few as you need
                                
                                 Pre-heat the oven to 475F and put frozen biscuits on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet; brush with buttermilk.  Put in the oven for 7 minutes, then without opening the oven turn the oven off and leave the biscuits in for 5 more or until lightly browned (don&apos;t open the door during this phase until the 5 min. are up).  add 1 min at a time until lightly browned.  Remove and enjoy!"
5,"This is a great recipe! I did not change any of the ingredients, but in the directions I put the flour and ice cold butter into a foodprocessor and blized it together for about 30 seconds- (Much easier than cutting it in) Then I continued as directed. The biscuts still came out light and flaky."
5,"I use a ""vegetable peeler"" to grate an entire stick of butter. It works great! So quick and so much easier! Toss those long thin flakes of butter with the dry ingredients to keep them from sticking back together. 
                                The best buttermilk biscuits I&apos;ve made since I began my quest for the perfect biscuit. I love the folding technique that left the biscuits with the perfect consistency not to mention flaky. Delicious!"
5,"OMG! These biscuits are incredible! They&apos;re so ""deceptively"" easy to make and they come out light, moist, and fluffy. Plus they rise nice and high -what more could you want from a buttermilk biscuit! I baked these on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and brushed the tops with melted butter during the last five minutes of baking...WOW what a great biscuit!"
5,"Thanks for the recipe and the video.  We love them.  
                                
                                I freeze the extra UNCOOKED BISCUITS for a quick eat in the future.  Bake them from the frozen state in the preheated oven at 450 for 8 minutes.  Don&apos;t open the door for another 8 minutes.  From freezer to plate = 16 minutes.  Plus, I notice no difference in taste or quality to the freshly made."
5,"The perfect biscuit recipe! Only change I made was just to use the whole butter stick. The method he uses to work the dough is brilliant. You are not in danger of over working the dough, as that is what makes a dense biscuit, by using the fold and press method. I have made these several times and the taste is wonderful. They bake up light and fluffy.  Two important tips that I have learned in making the perfect biscuit. 
                                1) use an up and down motion with your biscuit cutter or glass(whichever you use to cut your biscuits). Using a twisting motion causes the edges to seal and you will not get a good rise. 
                                2) when placing the cut biscuit dough on your baking sheet, place them so they touch one another. This also helps reach a wonderful rise as they bake. 
                                I have deemed this the definitive biscuit recipe and my search has ended here. As a matter of fact, I&apos;m making these in the morning since the kids, yet again, have another snow day. 
                                And as always... Enjoy!"
5,Yum!  I always make drop biscuits because of ease and convenience but am glad I took the plunge with cut outs!  These are easy and delicious!  You can&apos;t go wrong with Chef John&apos;s recipes!  p.s. I make sour milk instead of using buttermilk: 2T lemon juice and milk to make 1 cup.
3,"Well, I can see I&apos;m in the minority here, but while the flavor was good, these were dry and hard...Maybe it was something I did. I followed the recipe to a &apos;T&apos;. I&apos;ve made other biscuits in this manner w/o problems, so I can&apos;t imagine what went wrong. I will give these another try soon, and update. Thanks for sharing. :)"
5,"This is one of the best buttermilk recipes on this site.   I sometimes, after cutting in the butter, put it back in the fridge for about 30 mins. because the colder the better.  Other than that they are perfect.........you can also add a few teaspoons of sugar and then you have a dessert biscuit.     Substituting soured milk is not as good so worth investing in real buttermilk.  Thanks for printing this and highly recommend.  I am an award winning baker."
5,"Another winner from Chef John! The only change I made was with the flour. I thought it was an odd amount - technically, 1 7/8 cups is 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons. So I added the 2 tablespoons to the streusel mixture instead. This helped the streusel retain its crumbled texture without melting entirely into the cake. I used the remaining 1 3/4 cups of flour in the cake mixture, and it didn&apos;t adversely affect the crumb of the cake at all. It was deliciously moist!"
5,"Jan 2019 - This is my husband&apos;s, my mom&apos;s and my all time favourite! We are huge nut, cinnamon and brown sugar lovers!!!
                                
                                I tweaked the recipe only a bit: 
                                1) I doubled the amount of nuts (used walnuts instead of pecans) and chopped them with a knife, not too fine; 
                                2) I used only brown sugar for the crumb and doubled the cinnamon (we love cinnamon); 
                                3) I used organic sugar instead of white for the batter and put 3 eggs instead of 2, which made it easier to spread in the pan before baking. 
                                
                                I have now made this cake 4 times (in 1 month) due to requests and that is the ultimate recipe for my family. Both husband&apos;s and my families absolutely love it!!! Thank you so much!
                                
                                UPDATE July 2019 - I cannot express how loved this cake is. My husband took a bunch to work and it was gone within 3 minutes, with people asking for recipes or begging him to have me make it again. I have been making it at least once a month. Over time, I have mastered it. The change is to put a whole large container of sour cream- about 500ml. It makes the cake even more fluffy! I have now made it so many times that I eyeball all the ingredients and measure nothing! It turns out great every time!"
5,"Used 8 X 8 pan, cooking about an extra 10 minutes. Make as directed...no changes!  Best coffee cake ever. Never have to worry about this one lying around. Just when you think you&apos;ll sneak a piece... ha! It&apos;s gone!"
5,"My family loved this cake. Made it by recipe and it turned out perfect. The only thing I was wondering is if I can double the recipe for a bigger pan. Didn&apos;t want to ruin it so I did it in 8x8, but would like to do a bigger one."
5,"I made individual cakes, cup cake size.  They are light with a sweet crunchy top.  I didn&apos;t change a thing but the cooking time was changed for the cupcake.  The recipe made 24, I am going to freeze some!"
5,"This cake was delicious! My daughter doesn&apos;t usually eat cakes but she asked to try a piece of mine, after which she proceeded to steal the rest for herself.  I think the ingredient proportions were spot on, wouldn&apos;t change anything and will definitely make it again."
5,I doubled this and used a 9x13. So of course I had to bake it longer. Delicious! Also lowered the flour  by 2T  per original recipe and added it to the topping. Huge hit!!
5,"Phenomenal coffee cake Chef John!  Yummy filling/ Topping and super moist!  Everyone loves this!  To get that great layer of yummy goodness in the middle make sure to chop the pecans first, then measure out the 1 1/2 cups. I&apos;ve made this twice this week. The first time I doubled the recipe, and used a total of 3 cups of whole pecans that I coarsely chopped.  It filled two 8x8x2 pans and a 6 large muffin tin.  My husband and I loved it, but thought it needed more filling, and  I realized after looking at  Chef John&apos;s photo, my filling seemed lost (didn&apos;t chop the pecans up enough) but everyone still LOVED it and asked for the recipe). The second time I made a triple batch, decided to chop the pecans with my food processor, then measured them out (4 1/2 cups total). PERFECTION!  This time I filled both a  9x13x2, and an 8x8x2 pan with a beautiful layer in the middle and topping. I ate one piece right out of the oven, and of course it wasn&apos;t set yet, buy YUMMY!  Served it at a party the next day, everyone loved it!  I camp monthly as an assistant scout master with a boy scout troop. I&apos;ll for sure be making this on a future campout in a Dutch oven over charcoals, for the ""old goat (adult leaders) patrol"". pretty sure this will be one the scouts will want to learn to make after they try it. Thank you Chef John!!"
5,"I have made this so many times and it&apos;s always a hit! 
                                I especially love the way Chef John instructs to put melted butter in the streusel  - it&apos;s like a praline topping.
                                Most of the time I add blueberries in the middle and on top with the streusel. And if you want to prepare in advance,  it even freezes well!
                                Talk about GOOD! Thanks Chef John!"
3,Meh. I know I&apos;m in the minority but this was not the style of coffee cake I was looking for.  It was too eggy for me and not that light and fluffy coffee cake like you get at the bakery.
4,I have made this recipe and it was good.
5,Super quick and easy made these and everyone said they were the best stuffed mushrooms they&apos;ve ever had which I felt as well. Only difference is I used both white and baby Bella mushrooms and topped with a little extra cheese.
5,This is delicious! I loved that this dip already used reduced fat counterparts. I added some fresh ground pepper and a couple dashes of Frank&apos;s Hot Sauce but other than that I followed the recipe exact. Next time I make this I&apos;ll try this heated and see if it&apos;s just as good.
5,Made this dip for my husband&apos;s work potluck. Didn&apos;t have a food processor but used a hand mixer for the cream cheese sour cream and mayo. Used all ingredients exactly as listed on the recipe and it was a big hit! Didn&apos;t even need to add anything else. It is perfect as is. Thank you for the delicious recipe!
4,I bought some really good spinach artichoke dip about a week before making this one which caused me to seek out a recipe. I found this one and I think it really great. The consistency is well balanced and it&apos;s simple to make. The only thing I might change next time I make this is to process a little less (do more chopping with a knife and mixing) and maybe one less clove of garlic. It&apos;s strong right after making but maybe it will tame down in the refrigerator.
5,Delicious! The only change I made was to add a can of water chestnuts (chopped fine).
5,Doubled the recipe. Perfect!Fabulous... Im sure the original was even better but circumstances caused me to alter a little. Used one can of artichoke cause it&apos;s 3.50 for 14oz. Kept the juice and added it to spinach mix (called artichoke mix) in instructions. Oh and of course salted and peppered to taste. (White pepper) I only altered for amount and cost. So follow the original if you can.
5,I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to the mayo/cream cheese/sour cream mixture. This is a very easy recipe and is really good. I&apos;ve made it twice and everyone loved it.
5,I love spinach dip. This adds an upgrade. I made it exactly like the recipe except I added a can of heart of palm( such a great treat) and I added a little pimento (less than a teaspoon maybe just a little taste) to the cream cheese. It was better than I expected. I served it on mini bagels with different flavors of crackers and with fresh vegetables. It makes so much and can be served so many different ways. I am now asked to bring my special dip to everyone&apos;s gatherings. I love it! Oh I did cut way back on the garlic. Maybe 2 cloves and very little salt. The cans of artichokes and heart of palm have sufficient amount of salt.I never thought about water chestnuts. What an excellent idea. I am definitely going to add that next time.
4,The orginal recipe calls for drained water chestnuts and wow too much garlic. You might want to try roasting the garlic if you have time!
4,I did make changes to the base recipe. First I only used 1 clove of garlic and just grated it. I also grated the onion. Then I just mixed everything together in a bowl. I also added water chestnuts for crunch but it was tasty without it. I honestly don t know how 8 cloves of garlic could be used it is strong with just the one but I know that will mellow out as it rests overnight. Thank you for the recipe!
3,8 cloves of garlic was to much for my taste. Cut down on the garlic and it would be great. But my garlic loving friends enjoyed it.
4,"Of all the deviled eggs recipes I&apos;ve tried from this site Hubs thought this one of the best.  For me these were fairly average, but he appreciated their simplicity, enjoying that they didn&apos;t have a lot of added  ""stuff"" in them.  ""A deviled egg,"" he said, ""should taste like a deviled egg."""
5,"I made these for Thanksgiving tommorrow. I think, it is kind of hard to mess up a deviled egg. With that being said, the dill taste and garlic powder were a little stronger than I cared for when I first made them. However, the next day they tasted very good for some reason. I used Duke&apos;s regular mayonnaise and it worked well. For the dill I did use dry, but used 1/3 of the amount as suggested on my spice bottle if subbing for fresh. I made 9 eggs, so I just did 1 1/2 times the recipe. Although, I did end up adding 2-3 more spoons of mayo, after tasting, as I guess I just like them a little more creamy and a little extra dijon to taste. I decided to add a little of the dill on top for a garnish despite it being dry. I thought it looked a little like dry grass, but then after I sprinkled on some red paprika it took on a Christmasy appearance. I thought they were good, but others really liked them, so I will make them again next year."
5,"There seem to be two categories of deviled eggs: the dijon / mayo / vinegar flavor or the sweet / miracle whip flavor. Generally speaking, people tend to love one version and hate the other. As you can probably tell from the recipe, this is the dijon / mayo / vinegar version, and it&apos;s the best one I&apos;ve ever used. Fantastic! Now if only my sweetheart weren&apos;t a traitorous sweet / miracle whip version fan."
5,Eggsellent! Thanks for sharing :)
5,"I have tried five or six allrecipes.com five star recipes from this site and frankly did not like any of them. At all. As in ""Seriously? This was rated five stars? I can&apos;t even eat it!"" However this deviled egg recipe did not disappoint like the others. A classic egg recipe that has a bit of the tart bite that I remember and love. I made these eggs for Christmas Eve with no alterations and they were a huge hit. I made them again for Christmas Day dinner and added one thin slice of very finely chopped red onion and about 2 T (maybe less then a quarter of a stalk) of finely chopped celery and they were even better. This will be my Go To egg recipe from here on out. There is no need to try another one. Thank you!"
5,Love love love. Tangy pretty and easy. It&apos;s fun to experiment with other versions but this one is the one that reminds me of the version I grew up with it&apos;s pure comfort food and the MOST popular item on the potluck table. If you cut them on the short side and put them back in the paper carton you do not have a dish to recover after the potluck and they do not slide around on the way there. I sprinkle with paprika (because my Mom did) and garnish with parsley or cilantro or something fresh and green. Use Ken&apos;s Perfect Hard Boiled Egg recipe to guarantee success.
5,If you&apos;re serving immediately half the garlic powder because its very strong. If serving the next day serve as is. When the egg mixture has time to sit the garlic flavor calms down a bit.
5,Excellent classic deviled egg. Classic to me anyway =)... I don&apos;t care for Dijon so used regular spicy brown mustard. I might add a bit more vinegar next time but will definitely save and use this recipe. Too often my deviled eggs taste different every time I make them. Sometimes a good thing...sometimes not!
3,Either I did do something wrong or I didn&apos;t like it it was too thin
1,This was an awful dip...Thank goodness I did a trial run...when I took it out of the oven there were pools of oil on the top and sides...too many fatty ingredients? there were unmixed lumps of cream cheese in various cooked pockets although I had stirred thoroughly...the cream cheese should have been beaten with the other ingredients with heavy duty mix master after softened? the capers were overwhelming in taste...they should have been finely diced? the garlic was overwhelming...maybe 1 tablespoon vs. 2? You should only use fresh crab meat...the canned taste was unmistakable (I thought that with all the yummy sounding ingredients the canned taste would cook out)
4,The first time I made it I accidentally left our the Buttermilk. The second time I made it I wished that I had forgotten the Buttermilk; it was much better without it. Next time I make it I will add more crab meat and more artichoke hearts for a thicker heartier dip.
5,"Great!!!Very creamy dip with a wonderful blend of flavors.  I added extra Old Bay seasoning (I am from Maryland, we use this spice like salt and pepper!) Someone complained of the artichokes  overpowering the dip- I thought it was terrific since my family and I love artichokes (my kids favorite vegetable).  If you&apos;re after more of the crab flavor, scale down the artichokes, don&apos;t use them, or use more crabmeat. I have always noticed that artichokes in dips are the most dominant flavor. Like other reviews stated, this recipe can be adapted to many tastes, i.e. using shrimp, lobster, etc.  I actually didn&apos;t have cheddar or montery jack cheeses, and substituted asiago cheese and it was great.  Looking forward to making it again with the correct cheeses."
5,"I can say based on my taste test and the tasting by 15 other folks - THIS CRAB DIP (as I prepared it) IS AWSOME!!!} However, I am an accomplished cook so I can get a good feel for a recipe just by reading it. I don&apos;t think that 1/2 tsp of dried dill is overpowering for this recipe.
                                
                                While I love capers, a lot of people do not, so I used non-parielles which are smaller. I would certainly increase the amount of crab, using either all lump or a mix of lump and back-fin depending on the size of my wallet. I think a bit of sherry or white wine would be an acceptable addition. Or some lemon juice."
5,"Do NOT let the long list of ingredients intimidate you - it is WELL worth it.  God this recipe is so so good.  I did one of those &apos;well I should make sure it tastes ok before I serve it&apos; and kept eating it before it was baked!!!!  I used 2 cans lump crab meat (in the tuna section of the grocery store) and 1/3 can white crab meat from the same section, and was amazed at how good this came out.  The sourdough &apos;dish&apos; is brilliant.  Served this with wheat thins also, but may put some salt in next time, and serve it with Carr&apos;s Table Water crackers.  God I could eat this entire thing alone."
5,"I found this recipe a couple of years ago on allrecipes.com and it has become a favorite of our family! I always make it at holidays & when company comes over. Everyone always loves it. I know alot of people are unsure about putting capers in it, either because they think they wouldn&apos;t taste good in it or because they don&apos;t know what capers are. I assure you that the capers is a MUST for this recipe. Capers by themselves aren&apos;t appetizing, but when added to this recipe, gives it just the right flavor! Trust me!"
5,"Fantastic dip!!  I&apos;ve been looking for a great crab dip for years, and this is absolutely *IT*!  The ingredients can get a bit spendy - there&apos;s lots of good stuff in there.  But very much worth it.  
                                
                                I served it out of a 2 quart crock with sourdough bread and restaurant-style tortilla chips.  It also reheats well in the microwave.
                                
                                YUMMY!"
5,"3 words - OH MY GOSH! I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could - it was SO amazing I didn&apos;t want to share! I made a second batch and had some left over (hid it from my hubby) and it was good even cold! Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed the taste of the capers. If you&apos;ve never tried them before, add just a few - it gives this recipe a nice flavor. Thank you for sharing Joelle!"
5,This is the best crab dip I&apos;ve ever made. I cater for small events and every person I&apos;ve served it to loves it. I never have leftovers. Its even better with shrimp and scallops!
5,I made this recipe a couple weeks ago and just added a bit more cinnamon. My husband (a very picky eater) couldn&apos;t stay away from the nuts! They were litterally gone in a matter of minutes. I&apos;m making these to give as Christmas gifts this year because they taste so good! I would recommend baking in a 9x13 dish rather than on a cookie sheet as the sides of the pan make it much easier to push the nuts around without making a mess when you have to stir the mixture.
5,"Great as is. I also make this using 1/4 cup white & 1/4 cup brown sugars, 3 tablespoons of real maple syrup and a drop or two of maple flavored extract~Heavenly!!! :D"
5,I made these low carb using splenda instead of the sugar. They came out perfect.
5,"This was exactly what I had been hoping for. I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the egg white and water mixture. Reminds me of the nut snack I had at the Baldknobbers show in Branson, Mo."
5,I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!!! My 6 year old daugher and I made these for her class for Texas Day--we were asked to make something with pecans so this was perfect!!! I did follow other reviewers advice and used 1 cup of sugar and a tbs of cinnamon--also made a double batch!! WOW--they were awesome and made the house smell great!! They tasted so good we could not stop eating them--I feared there would be none left for my daughters class!!!!! LOL!!! Thanks for a great and EASY recipe!! I just needed to add something--I was at my daughters school today and was BOMBARDED by the teachers AND kids wanting this recipe!! It was a huge hit--even with 6 year olds!!!!!! Thanks!!!
5,Wow!  Easy and absolutely delicious!  I submitted a photo of the finished product and it was hard to stop picking at it during the cooking process!  I only had half a pound of pecans but used all the same measurements and it came out perfectly coated and delicious!  I will definintely give these out for Christmas.  It&apos;s much better than the nut kiosk you see in the malls.  It&apos;s so easy to make its absolutely effortless!  A must recipe for the holidays!
5,"I use a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon and a little more than four cups of nuts (usually a mixture of pecans, walnuts, and almonds)."
5,Wow! These were SO easy to make - much easier than the candied walnuts on this site where you have to take the sugar syrup to a soft ball stage. I ruin a pan every time I make those but I didn&apos;t realize there was such a simpler alternative. These by comparison are a piece of cake. I made them with Splenda and unfortunately they do have a bit of an aftertaste so next time I&apos;ll just use real sugar and live a little. I baked them on a parchment covered jelly roll pan so clean-up was a breeze too!
5,Very addictive! So super quick and easy to make. My family LOVED these so I made them again the next day. YUMMY!
3,I literally just tried this recipe. I was very glad that I found it because my mom just gave me two big bags of pecans a couple of days ago and I had no idea what to do with them. however after just 30 minutes I felt I had to take them out of the oven. it smells like they were burning and it looked like they were burning. I did everything exactly as listed. I saw one other person&apos;s review who said the same thing but everyone else says that they followed it exactly and they turned out great. I&apos;m a little confused because I could not see any way that my pecans could have stayed in the oven another 30 minutes
5,These are delicious! I used kalamata olives which aren&apos;t called for here but that&apos;s what I had. Surprisingly the olives didn&apos;t overpower the seasonings & after sitting at room temp for about an hour the flavors just melded together. Wonderful recipe & next time I&apos;ll use the olives that are specified. Nice job:o)
5,Loved these olives and it took no time to make. The green cerignolas olives were especially good. Thanks for sharing MIZDIZ.
5,These nibbles are fantastic! Made them (along with several other munchies) for a weekend cocktail party and these were the first to go! Try them you won&apos;t be disappointed!
5,delicious...easy to prepare great flavor and presents very nice. made these for appetizer. reduced the rosemary as my husband is not a huge fan. substitute with thyme....
3,They are ok I don&apos;t think I liked the mixture of olives and orange juice. They would have been better without the juice for me. Thank you for sharing!
5,These are so yummy! I used a varity of olives and they all tasted wonderful. Followed the recipe as is.
5,What an awesome make-ahead party nibble! They&apos;re delicious they&apos;re super-easy and they go with any Mediterranean cuisine! I&apos;ve tried them twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect. If you have time that&apos;s definitely the way to go. The second time I had only a few moments to throw something together the night before a family gathering so I just threw everything in a sealed jar shook it a few times and let it soak in the fridge overnight. They weren&apos;t as good as the cooked version but it was still tasty. You do need to increase the liquids if you&apos;re going to do it this way though.
4,These were good other family members asked for the recipe.
5,Soo Good! I used one can each green black and kalamata olives with a semi-sweet wine and only 1 T olive oil. They get even better after sitting a few days.
5,"Gets folks laughing! Worth the effort.
                                Tips (from me & others): use herbed or ranch flavored whipped cream cheese (it will still look white); don&apos;t simply slice the olive, remove a small section to accomodate the filling; pipe whipped cream cheese using a sandwich bag; make ""beaks"" thin to avoid splitting the ""head"" while inserting them; try inserting ""beaks"" vertically rather than horizontally; ""heads"" take the most time - make them the night before and leave them soaking in the olive brine. Don&apos;t forget to make baby penguins! Fill a single olive & set on top of carrot feet with large whole facing up. Insert toothpick through center to pin it to the ""feet"". Set ""beak"" into cream cheese filling of large whole - it will hold it in place. Do a variation on this to make ""swimming"" penguins. Fill a single olive. Stick beak in one end and feet in the other. Shave off a small portion from the underside of the olive to keep it from rolling around. For ""environment"" we used an aluminum pizza pan and foam board ($1.99)for an ice flow. Trace the pan on the foam board. Cut out the circle with a craft knife. Cut circle in half jaggedly to simulate ice flow. Cut remaining half into pieces; glue and stack in layers to create ""hills"". Cover pizza pan with blue plastic wrap. Place ""ice flow"" into the pizza pan. Tape plastic wrap to bottom of the pan to hold it in place. When placing penguins, push the toothpick into the foamboard to hold them in place. Transports easily this way."
5,These were really a hit with the kids at our Christmas family gathering. Instead of using frilly toothpicks I went to a party store and purchased the toothpicks with the flags from diferent countries. I also made a cheese ball in the shape of an igloo and placed my little guys all around it. Very cute!
5,"These are too adorable!!  I added some garlic powder to the cream cheese for a little flavor.  Also, I heated the cream cheese briefly (about 20 seconds) in the microwave and then put it in a ziploc bag.  By cutting off a small corner of the bag, you can easily squeeze the cream cheese into the olive using the ziploc like a pastry bag!"
5,This was a great recipe! It was a hit at a family picnic I made it for. I was able to get 25 penguins out of a can of jumbo olives. For the beaks I had to cut a horizontal slit into the smaller olives and I sliced the beaks thinner so they would fit better. I made these the night before and was worried they would get dried out so I stood them up in a tupperware container and placed a small amount of water in the bottom and sealed the top. They were fine the next day. They took about an hour to make. I needed to transport them safely on a two-hour car ride so I used the top and bottom of an egg carton and leaned the penguins on their backs in each section of the egg carton which worked great and prevented them from shifting and getting stuck together. I used an herbed cream cheese spread which worked well. A couple people thought they were chocolate covered treats so you may want to tell people they&apos;re olives! I&apos;ll definitely make these again!
5,"This is my favorite recipe for the winter holiday season and I make it for each and every party I attend. It definitely takes a little practice to get the penguins assembled correctly but after about 5 it&apos;s a snap. My boyfriend helps me make them and we get an assembly line going. One thing I do to add some flair is to use a basic frosting pump (same thing you would use to fill deviled eggs) to squirt the cream cheese into the olives. This creates a ""ruffled tuxedo"" effect down the penguin&apos;s front. These are always a hit and each penguin will have its own personality! People can never get enough of these. You can also make an ""igloo"" to sit next to the penguins out of cream cheese. Use a toothpick to draw the ice bricks."
5,"Stuffed olives with cream cheese has always been a favorite of mine but I would never have thought to shape them like a penguin. CUTE! I like to use the ""onion & chives"" flavored cream cheese. It gives an added flavor. To easily get the cream cheese into the olives I use a pastry bag with a #12 tip. I&apos;ll now need to buy a smaller tip to fill the smaller olives. Great recipe!"
5,I made these darlings for my sister&apos;s wedding shower and they were a smash hit! We arranged them in rows and they looked like an adorable little army! One suggestion would be to add dry ranch mix to the cream cheese to add a little flavor. Great party appetizer!
5,One quick suggestion for an easier scarf. Use a potato peeler and peel thin strips of carrot. Wraps easier and coordinates with the feet and beak!
5,"These are hilarious! My friends and I made them for a ""girls"" night and giggled all the way through. So fun! I found that putting a little cream cheese on the carrot bottom (feet) made the body stick better. And the thicker the slices the more they stand up on their own. Not too thick though because you don&apos;t want an overwhelming carrot flavor.."
2,They turned out looking really cute but that was about all they were good for. They were not very tasty.
5,These are really good.  I have a few pointers.  Too make ingred. mix better together-- mix sausage with Biscuit THEN add cheese.  The ball don&apos;t have the powdery white appearance and they mix easier.  Also I like to cook these on parchment paper and they slide right off the paper.  Enjoy.
5,I learned how to make sausage cheese balls in high school and have used the same recipe for over 10 years. My family has requested these at every  baby and bridal shower until I have gotten sick of making them and even eating them. The only difference in the way I make them and this is that I cook them longer. They really need to cook for up to 25 minutes. Otherwise you end up with raw sausage in the middle. I have tried different brands of sausage and it makes a difference. Some are greasier than others and some are drier. And I have found that Aberdeen sausage (spelling?) (it may be Aberdeen Farms) works the best. You can find it at walmart and it usually is the cheapest. If the ones on the edge of your pan end up dry just put all the sausage balls in a covered container and let them sit covered until they cool. The steam will help the dry ones become moist. I always cover mine to cool to hold in the flavor even if they don&apos;t dry out because it seems to make them taste even better if the flavors mingle.
5,"These sausage balls were so good.  With 6 children, I don&apos;t cook spicy for them, but I did add a bit of black pepper and some dried chives to add some flavor.  However, I had to change the baking a bit.  The first batch I made came out SOO greasy (of course using uncooked sausage), even after laying them on a paper towel to drain and cool.  I took my cooling rack and placed it on a cookie sheet, then put the unbaked sausage balls on that.  When they cooked, the grease dripped down through the cooling rack into the pan below.  Because of the drippings, you will need to get a spatula to get them off the rack, but cooking them this way they have yet to burn!!  I cooked them for 25 minutes or so instead of 10 minutes like the recipe says.  After cooking them like this, my husband tasted them and said they were the best tasting sausage balls he had ever had.  My children ate them as fast as I was making them!!  I will be cooking them this way from now on.  We had these for Thanksgiving appetizers this morning!!  :)"
5,"I see so many reviews that say ""this was dry.. not enough liquid"", but if anyone actually read the instructions, they would see that nowhere it says to pre-cook the sausage. Its supposed to be raw. I guess the person who added it should have clarified that."
5,"outstanding!  i&apos;ve made sausage balls before but these were especially delicious & got many rave reviews.  i used hot sausage, extra-extra sharp cracker barrel cheese and grated it myself (i think this was the key), and the 2c bisquick.  i made about 60 good size balls.  i took the idea of some others and baked them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet to drain grease but also it kept them soooo moist!  i baked at 375 for about 18 minutes.  perfect!  thanks!!"
5,I tried this recipe but with one change..use stove top stuffing instead of baking mix..it adds so much flavor!!!!
5,"The great reviews of this recipe saved me a lot of aggravation with this one... thanks everyone! I left the sausage out for about 20 min. before starting the recipe and finely grated the cheddar cheese by hand... those were the two best ideas from the reviews. Then you really have to get in there with your hands (those disposable thin kitchen gloves work great for this part) and knead the dough. It was kind of fun actually :)  Also, as many reviewers have suggested, line your baking sheets with parchment. I had no sticking whatsoever. Finally, my own suggestion is to bake them longer than 10 min... I baked mine about 20 min., flipping them over after 10 min. This could partly be my oven&apos;s fault, but I&apos;d say you&apos;d at least want to bake for 15 min. There&apos;s nothing worse than an undercooked sausage ball... yuck! Anyway, the final results were very yummy and I&apos;ve got a lot left over in the freezer ready and waiting for Superbowl Sunday!!!"
5,I FOUND A GREAT EASY WAY TO MIX IS TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO A GALLON SIZE (OR LARGER) ZIP LOCK A KNEAD AWAY:) NO MESS AND NO DISHES TO WASH:)
5,"This is the recipe I&apos;ve used for 20+ years, adding another good handful more of cheddar. I can&apos;t believe some recommend to cook the sausage before mixing. No, you do NOT cook the sausage first! Your sausage balls will be dry and lacking the flavor the grease gives them during baking. Just toss them in a paper-towel lined bowl to absorb any excess grease afterward. If you use nice sausage (it really is worth a buck or two more), you won&apos;t have the super greasy problem to begin with. If you live in the southeast, look for Neese&apos;s Hot Sausage (the BEST!). Failing that, Jimmy Dean is fine (don&apos;t go lower in quality than that, tho). Set the ingredients out an hour ahead of time. You have to use some muscle to get it totally blended. You&apos;ll know it&apos;s ready when you can smoosh it into one big old smooth mass that isn&apos;t crumbly or dry.  DON&apos;T add liquid if it seems dry - that isn&apos;t the problem! The warmth of your hands and the kneading will do the trick. Just keep at it; it&apos;ll end up just right. I make mine large-marble size (ends up walnut size after baking) and cook about 15 mins. This is THE recipe to try. Don&apos;t use tons of baking mix or add liquids like some recipes call for. Use parchment/silpat; the bottoms won&apos;t over-brown or stick. For heaven&apos;s sake - whatever you do - DO NOT precook the sausage! :)"
3,"I followed this recipe EXCEPT I did NOT cook the sausage in advance.  If you do that, the sausage balls do not have a grease to help the bisquit mix cook while baking.  I just mixed everything together in a bowl and then baked.  Turned out wonderful.  Also - use a flavorful sausage for better tasting rolls."
5,"I&apos;m ashamed of how long it&apos;s taken me to review this considering how often I make the recipe. This is perfection in hot-dip form. EVERYONE asks me for the recipe when I serve this at parties (and yes I do give credit!). The changes I make to the recipe are minimal. I up the onion to 2 tbs I up the garlic to 2 cloves. I decrease the mustard to 1 tbs (I find it makes the dip a little too sharp with 2 tbs) and I add a big dash of hot sauce. Not a big difference in the grand scheme of things. My Mother-in-Law called me from the grocery store recently because she was having difficulty finding the roasted red peppers. If you do as well they&apos;re usually located by either the olives and pickles or they&apos;re located by the ""fancy"" canned goods (like marinated mushrooms etc) depending on the store. The only other note is that I can only find a 12oz jar of the roasted red peppers. I usually use most of it (scraping off any charred skin left on the peppers) and just snack on any leftovers while waiting for the dip to come out of the oven.:D"
5,"My friends and I really enjoyed this dip. Based on previous reviews I made a few changes: used 2 tablespoons of dry minced onions used 4 cloves cloves of minced garlic used 2 cups of shredded monterey jack / colby jack cheese and added a half cup of shredded parmesan cheese. I prepared the dip in two Pyrex 5 X 7"" dishes and cooked them approximately 25 minutes. I plan on making this for many upcoming parties."
5,I have a recipe similar to this using artichokes instead of the peppers. The sweetness of the roasted peppers compared to the saltiness of the artichokes makes this a completely different dip however. I added extra garlic several chopped jalepenos and about 1/2 c. of parmesan cheese. The combination of sweet peppers salty cheese and spicy jalepenos is extraordinary!
5,Fabulous recipe to tinker with as you please and still have it turn out great. I had a cheddar/jack mix so I used that and I used 1/2c mayo/1/2c sour cream to cut down on grease and I didnt have dijon mustard so I used Cleveland Stadium mustard (its a brown mustard) and my guests loved it--said it was a definite keeper. Also added a bit of horseradish and only the 7 oz jar of peppers. Served with Frito scoops. So this recipe is not too sensitive--you can substitute and it still turns out as a crowd pleaser. Very easy and quick to make and goes over very well. I quickly patted excess liquid from my roasted peppers to make sure there wasn&apos;t too much liquid and it turned out excellent. Definite keeper. Think it would go well served in bread bowl with bread pieces or with cut up pieces of bagel. Very versatile as to type of chip/bread for dipping.
5,This was amazing. I prepared it the day before and took it to a friend&apos;s house heated it up and we devoured it. We all loved it and I had to pass out the recipe. I roasted my own bell peppers instead of using the jar. I used 2 but I think 3 would have been even better. Yummy Yummy!
1,Good if you like mustard-flavored mayo. I had high hopes for this b/c of the recipe&apos;s high rating and the fact that I love red peppers but to me the taste of this dip was nothing more than hot mayo and dijon mustard. Ick.
4,Everyone loved this dip - especially the teenagers! The only changes I would make would be to use a little less mayo and more cheese. The color was perfect for the Christmas buffet.
5,Two words: DE-LISH!!! I used lite mayo and 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it was still super creamy. One note: don&apos;t rewarm in microwave it will seperate. LOVE THIS DIP!!!
5,This dip was very good. I made it for a party and everyone kept telling me how good it was and asked for the recipe. I used hot pepper jack cheese for a little spice. I served it with tortilla chips and small toasted pumpernickel bread squares I am so glad to have found this recipe. Thanks!
5,My husband made this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was delicious. Since neither of us are a fan of goat cheese we just substituted regular cream cheese for the goat cheese. It was a beautiful presentation and very tasty indeed.
5,This party cheese ball is savory yet tangy and a different twist on the traditional cheddar-based cheese ball. I made this for a Christmas gathering and everyone really liked the taste of the cream cheese and goat cheese blend. For the outside I used raspberry-glazed almonds and also served it alongside pepper-jelly. The savory cheese fruit-glazed almonds and sweet-spicy pepper jelly was a great combination to spread on party crackers!
4,It made a big hit at my Christmas party. The presentation is great. I didn&apos;t have the herbs that were suggested so I just added Lemon Pepper and garlic powder instead. The goat cheese is an important ingredient so try to use this without substituting. There&apos;s a lot of almonds in this dish but splurge for the effect.
3,I love Chef John&apos;s recipes but this was not for my taste. I did not like the taste of all of the herbs I felt like the tarragon overpowered everything. Next time I will try it with half the amount of herbs. It made for a beautiful presentation however very festive!
5,I absolutely love goat cheese and when I saw this recipe included it I knew it would be a hit. I doubled the recipe to make two and they were completely devoured at my party!
5,Delicious and impressive! I did a taste test with roasted and raw almonds and roasted won hands down. Couldn&apos;t find fresh tarragon so used probably about 1/4 tsp. dried and I think that worked just fine. Also used about twice as much garlic as the recipe called for and used garlic salt instead of plain salt. I love garlic. Used saran sprayed with cooking spray to help mold the pinecones shape. It did make a lot! Everyone loved it and took pictures.
4,"The more parsley the more refreshing it tasted. I like the kick of goat cheese so used 6 ounces and cut back 2 ounces of cream cheese. Mine didn&apos;t look as beautiful as Chef John&apos;s, but everyone dug the pine cone effect."
5,The only problem I had was everyone thought it was to pretty to eat!
5,Hilarious! My sister used to make a pinecone cheesball 60 YEARS AGO -although I&apos;m not sure the ingredients were exactly the same. Sisters tasted good.
4,"I gave this as gifts this year in little canning jars. Everyone wanted the recipe. Just a tip - it tastes better after at least a day in the fridge. Add sugar to taste..I probably cut out about a 3rd of it, and increased the peppers because I like it hot!"
5,I make this and spoon it over cream cheese. Let it set in the refrigerator over night so it blends some with the block of cream cheese (make sure and poke holes in the block of cream cheese. Serve with crackers. I won 1st place on a radio station Thanksgiving contest for this salsa dip recipe.
5,"I&apos;ve made this recipe, but decreased the sugar to 1/2, 1 lime & 2 jalepenos. Soooo yummy. The best thing you can do though, is dump the salsa over a cube of cream cheese. It&apos;s so pretty too. Serve with tortillas chips and/or crackers."
5,This is a great recipe! The color texture and flavor of sweet & spicy is perfect. I adjust the peppers for my kids but I like it with a little more kick than they do. p.s. the longer it sits the more hot it becomes and it saves in the fridge for 7-9 days.
5,I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge success with the whole family. I spread cream cheese on a platter and spread the salsa over the top of the cream cheese with whole berries for garnish--a great balance of flavors and pretty too. This will be a regular for future holidays.
5,WOW! What a wonderful way to have fresh cranberries! Love all the fresh ingredients. As a bonus it&apos;s simple and easy to make. My family loved it so much the only thing we served it with was a fork!
5,This is better than the low-calorie recipe I lost and was looking for! I substitued 1/2 cup Splenda for the sugar and added a splash of orange juice. I have made this recipe before with dried cilantro (2TBLS) and it turns out okay - fresh is definitely better though!
5,I have a recipe very similar that calls for 1/2 cup honey..its as follows: 3 c frozen cranberries 1/2 med medium red onion chopped 2 jalapeno peppers seeded & chopped 1/2 cup cilantro fresh 1/2 cup honey 2 T fresh lime juice and 1 T grated orange rind. Cover and chill 8 hrs. Always YUM
5,MD Anderson suggests this for healthy living to their cancer patients. It&apos;s fantastic! My mother lost the recipe and said that this one is close enough. Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and she uses orange zest as in addition to the other stuff. We leave off the jalapenos for a more mild salsa...but personally...I like the jalapenos! Pour over cream cheese for sure! However I could just eat this with a spoon!:) UPDATE::: My mom found her recipe! ADD GINGER!! 2 Tablespoons of fresh ginger and 4 green onions. Hers only calls for 1/4 cup of the cilantro. ENJOY!
3,Too sweet for my tastes.
5,"Yum!  This was my first attempt at making gauc and I was not let down by the high rating on this recipe.  I adapted it a little to my taste by adding more cilantro and garlic and adding some ground cumin.  When choosing your avocados choose ones that are blemish free and have a slight give when squeezed lightly.  There are so many different varities that color is not a good indication.  Sure this has a lot of fat in it, but it&apos;s the good fat that our bodies need to keep are skin supple and our joints lubricated (tell that to my hips!)!
                                
                                07/07/08 Update
                                I just had to update my review on this recipe.  My first review was the first time that I had made this recipe - now I am known for my guac!  I don&apos;t use a recipe any more, but it is similiar to this.  I think the key to delicious guac is lots of garlic and a lot of lime juice.  The lime juice does more than flavor the quac - it keeps it from turning brown.  I also add jalepenios (sp?) seeded, ribbed and finely chopped for a little heat.  Another thing I add is some cumin - one of my favorite spices.  Teh quac I make is chunky, but chunky from the tomatoes, onion and peppers - the avocado I make very smooth.  You don&apos;t want to make this too soon as some discoloration can occur.  I have made it the night before and it&apos;s fine but I prefer to make it a few hours before hand.  That way it stays nice and fresh but the flavors have time to marry.  Regardless of when you make it always flatten the top surface smooth and squirt the jui"
5,"I line in Arizona and my husband and I both love guacamole. We&apos;ve eaten guacamole too many times to count and have made it countless times before. WE BOTH LOOOOVED THIS RECIPE! I followed the recipe exactly and it was THE BEST GUACAMOLE I EVER MADE! My husband is picky about salsa and guacamole, due to his grandmother who makes everything so awesome, but he even said this was the BEST ONE YET! MUST TRY!!! I WILL ONLY MAKE THIS GUACAMOLE FROM NOW ON! Thanks!"
5,"This was excellent!!  When I can find ripe avacados at Costco, I buy them because they come 5 to a package and that&apos;s cheaper than buying them individually.  I scaled the recipe down (using only 1 avacado) because it was just me eating this. Instead of chopping up the onions and garlic, I used onion and garlic powder.  In my opinion, they taste just as good and are much quicker.   I also added a spoonful of salsa to mine.  I love eating this alone with chips or as a side dish to my lunch or dinner.  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitley make again!!"
5,"Great Guacamole! This was everything guacamole should be: smooth and creamy with just the right amount of flavor. Nothing overpowering, nothing artificial, no jarred salas or other oddities to make it some sort of ""creation"". I de-seeded the tomatoes, used red onion and added a little more than 1/4 tsp. of cumin - it went great with warm tortilla chips! This recipe is a definite keeper for sure!!!"
5,"Awesome taste!  It took me longer than 10 minutes to prepare, but it might be that I am just slow at chopping and cutting.  Also, be wary of over mashing the avacado - I thought I didn&apos;t like it chunky, but smooth becomes kinda soupy.  With the whole lime, this doesn&apos;t turn brown for over 24 hours in a sealed container.  Best to eat immediately (or after chilled for an hour), lots of liquid pools in it after a couple days. UPDATE:  Do not freeze this to use at a later time ... the consistency is just strange after thawing and the flavors change.  Still the best Guac, though. :)
                                
                                Thank you for a great addition! :D"
5,"Delicious. NOTES: *I leave out the tomatoes and serve pico de gallo alongside. On the rare occasion there are leftovers, mixed-in tomato makes the guacamole go off faster. Same amount of work, just throw the tomatoes in a separate bowl and toss some extra onion, chili, cilantro, and lime. *Lime acts like salt on the palate, so add salt after the lime juice; you will end up using less. *I always add some ground toasted cumin seed and a seeded jalapeno. *Great with and without garlic. *Reserve half the avocado chunks to add at the end for textural variety. *The most important thing, though, is to use ripe avocados. Buy them a day or 2 beforehand, then let them sit in a brown paper bag on the counter with a ripe apple, pear, or bananas until the avocados are softer. *If the avocados aren&apos;t perfectly delicious, I add a little extra virgin olive oil to the mix."
5,"Excellent! My husband loved it! Fresh Cilantro is a must(.70 cents a bunch). We like chunkier style Guacamole so mashed two of the avocados & chopped the third into very small pieces. These pieces will mush up alittle as you stir in other ingredients, but still give it alittle chunk. If it is still too chunky you can mash it alittle with back of spatula. I will use this recipe on a regular basis. Thanks!"
5,this recipe is easy and delicious! we make it all the time... (and add more cayenne to spice it up) LOVE IT! tip - leave the pits in the container when refrigerating... it&apos;s lasts longer without going brown.
5,add a tbls or two of sour cream
2,"Wow, way too much salt! I think it could have been good with just a 1/2 tsp of salt.  I even used 4 avocados instead of the three mentioned in recipe."
4,"Great dip for football season! I used Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce, 1/3 less-fat cream cheese (aka Neufchatel), and 1 lb. of fresh chicken that was boiled for 20 minutes (or until done) and then shredded. However, to avoid the strange ""orange sherbert"" color of the dip, I layered the ingredients in a 8""x11"" baking dish as follows:  Mix together the softened cream cheese and ranch dressing and spread evenly in the bottom of the dish.  Then mix together the shredded chicken and wing sauce (about 2/3 bottle)and layer on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Sprinkle just a small amount of shredded cheese (I used Colby/Jack) over the top.  Bake at 350 for about 20-25 minutes or until dip is heated through and cheese is melted.  I just think people tend to shy away from the dip when it&apos;s all mixed together because of the strange color.  It&apos;s more recognizable (retains a brighter red color) when it&apos;s layered and gets gobbled up faster!"
5,"I have made a variation of this recipe for over a year now and have never been disappointed.  I suggest using more chicken and more hot sauce with this recipe. Also, if you use the chedder cheese, don&apos;t use the pre-shredded bags from the grocery store.  The cheese in those bags is coated with flour and it seems to make the dip oiler."
5,"the biggest hit for the superbowl party!  I did use bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch because thats what you eat with buffalo chicken!  I also used 2 boneless chicken breasts instead of canned chicken (i cant stand canned meats) grilled it in a pan, cut it into bite sized pieces, put it back in the pan with the hot sauce. When I mixed the the cream cheese and bleu cheese together I added more hotsauce for more of a kick.  Baked in an 8x8 pan, 350 for 20 minutes.  Dip was gone in minutes!   will make 100 more times!!"
5,"A KEEPER! A really tasty and unique dip with the perfect amount of zip. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, boiled and shredded. (I can&apos;t stand canned meat) I mixed all ingredients and baked it in a uncovered casserole dish for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Then I converted it to a crock pot to keep it warm. I served it with tostito scoops and celery. It was the talk of the party!!"
5,"I got this recipe about a month ago off of this site to take to a pitch-in and since then have made it 3 more times!  It&apos;s a total hit and everyone loves it!  My changes (okay, I made quite a few): use 1/2 cup Frank&apos;s Buffalo Wing Sauce and 1/2 cup Red Hot, 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing and 1/2 cup Blue Cheese dressing, and put almost all of the cheese in the dip and just sprinkle some on top.  Oh yeah, and we used fresh chicken shredded in the food processor as someone suggested.  And we didn&apos;t like the crock pot method - it made the dip get dried out pretty quickly.  We just cooked it on the stove and put it into a serving dish (we did end up puting in the microwave a few times, but that was okay).  This is great because the recipe itself is very low carbs and you can use low fat cream cheese, dressing, and cheese and you don&apos;t experience all that much guilt... especially when served with celery sticks (although those Fritos scoops are fabulous!)  Thanks for this one!"
5,"This is a great and easy appetizer to make and is very well received and I have never brought any home from any party.  I read the reviews before making it and like many others I made a few modifications that I think helped make the recipe better.  I used 1 lb of skinless chicken breasts which I cleaned, sliced into strips and par boiled for 15 minutes, drained, and cooled for a few minutes.  When the chicken is cool it will be very easy to shred with your fingers.  I used a large skillet where I placed 1 Cup of Frank’s Red hot which is what is used in Buffalo, NY at the Anchor Bar to make real Buffalo chicken wings.  I also added a ½ stick of butter which is also a very common ingredient in the preparation of Buffalo chicken wings.  While the chicken and Frank’s is warming slowly, I mixed one cup of Blue cheese dressing and the cream cheese until smooth and placed it into the refrigerator until I was ready to make the dip. After the chicken and Frank’s were good and warm I placed this into a plastic container for later use as well.  This gets everything ready for the next day or for later in the day to just place it together and warm in the oven.  When I was ready for the dip I pre-heated the oven to 350 placed the blue cheese mixture into the bottom of a 7x11” baking pan and layered the chicken onto the top of the blue cheese.  I topped the whole thing with a small amount of shredded mozzarella / provolone cheese and po"
5,"This is sooo good!!!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in the oven for 20 min instead of the slow-cooker. Next time I&apos;ll try it with blue cheese dressing instead od ranch. Either way, you can&apos;t go wrong!"
5,I made this today for the first time and it is excellent!! I have been trying out lots of different recipes to prepare for my annual Halloween party and this one will definately make it to the table! Canned chicken is repulsive to me so I used rotissary chicken (from Sams) which has such wonderful flavor and compliments the entire dish. Also...nothing beats Franks Original Hot Sauce! Used blue cheese instead of ranch and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Combined all in the crock pot and let it sit on low for a couple of hours. Served with tortilla chips celery and scoops. Yum yum yum!!!
5,"This is excellent. I&apos;ve made this dish many times and everyone keeps requesting it again. I mix 1/2 Ranch dressing and 1/2 blue cheese. I do not use the chedder cheese. I tried it once and did not care for the oily orange greasy appearance. A few other ""improvements"" I&apos;ve made are I melt 1/2 a stick of butter before warming the meat in the frying pan. Also I recently began substituting ground turky and found it much eaiser than cooking and shredding chicken. It has a nicer texture in the dip and tastes the same."
3,Definitely wasn&apos;t what I expected....  probably won&apos;t make again.
5,"I&apos;ve made this recipe at least 10 times and I absolutely love it!  People I&apos;ve made them for can&apos;t get over how good they are!  A friend told me they are WAY better than any candied nuts she&apos;s bought at stores/festivals, etc.  For a pound of nuts, I only use 1/3 C of sugar as I don&apos;t believe in using much sugar in anything.  They are PLENTY sweet with that amount!  I also add a t. of vanilla extract to the wet mix!  YUM!!!!!  I&apos;ve never tried walnuts but I am right now...they are currently baking.  Will let you all know how it turns out!"
5,"It was DELICIOUS! I changed some things, though. Instead of water, I used vanilla extract. I also lowered the sugar amount to 2/3 cup-- 1/3 being regular white sugar and the other 1/3 brown sugar. The first time I did this, I didn&apos;t lower the salt amount, and it tasted like a salty-sweet snack. They were delicious! This time, I&apos;m lowering it to maybe half a teaspoon for a sweeter taste. You can&apos;t go wrong with this recipe!
                                
                                UPDATE: I lowered the salt to 1/4 tsp as recommended by some users, and I definitely recommend it."
4,I thought these were very good with the sugar reduced A LOT.  1 Cup sugar for a pound of nuts just seemed like to much to me.  I used just a bit less than 1/3 cup sugar and it was more than enough.
5,"As is, this recipe makes a delicious candied nut. There&apos;s no need to change anything -- the amount of sugar and salt are perfect. But if you want to kick it up a couple of notches, here are a few suggestions:
                                - As mentioned before, replace the water with vanilla.
                                - Add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper to the sugar/cinnamon mixture. The unexpected heat makes people go crazy for them! 
                                - After you mix the nuts in with the egg mixture, remove them from it using a slotted spoon and then toss them into the sugar mixture. All of the excess egg is not necessary. 
                                BTW, this recipe works with mixed nuts, as well, but pecans are best. Enjoy!"
5,"Everyone at work raves about how delicious these are! I double the batch using 2 pounds of pecans, 2 tsp of cinnamon and 2 egg whites, but then I make some changes:  I replace the water with 2 tablespoons of vanilla, I also cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and only use 1.5 teaspoon of salt.  My co-workers beg me to bring these in when we do our monthly pitch-in lunches."
5,"Out. Stand. Ing.  Addictive and dangerous, as well. I followed the recipe to the letter, eschewing the addition of vanilla or playing around with the amount of sugar and salt.  If you follow the recipe to letter, you will be elated with the results.  Try it once as is, if you feel they&apos;re not insanely perfect, then I guess start making additions, subtractions or substitutions.  I certainly won&apos;t .  They&apos;re a perfect 10 and would make a very welcome gift for special occasions or the holidays.  Helpful hint:  to coat with sugar mixture, place sugar in a large plastic bag, add egg wash coated pecans and shake the bag to coat them.  Each piece will come out evenly coated."
3,The recipe and directions are overall great. I recommend either omitting the salt all together or decrease the amount to 1/4 teaspoon. An entire teaspoon makes this treat more salty than sweet. I also replaced the water with a teaspoon of vanilla. I never understood the use of water when you can replace it with flavor. And I still had plenty of wet mix to coat the pound of pecans.
5,"Sooo good! I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and they were lightly sweet and perfect for us! Will make them often, specially to add to couple  spinach and goat cheese salads that we like from this site, mmmmm!"
5,"This is a great and simple recipe! I read all the reviews first to see what people did different, and I did them all plus my own twist.
                                First I reduced the sugar to only 1/2 cup, and added honey! Replaced the water with vanilla, same amount of cinnamon, a dash of water,NO SALT but what I did different is instead of mixing the sugar mix separate i just added it in when the pecans were coated with the egg mix.  Then to give it a good twist for the adults I added a cap full of whiskey and vodka. 
                                Such a great snack for everyone, naturally for children leave out the alcohol but still a great snack. Believe me by adding the alcohol gives it a different sweet taste, can&apos;t wait to do this again!"
5,I made these for the first time last night and the family loved them. I used butter flavored hawaiian rolls  and doubled the dijon mustard. I also left out the poppy seeds and used a mixture of minced garlic and onion powder (1 tbsp total). I made 12 with swiss cheese and 12 with muenster cheese. Don&apos;t be afraid to pour the entire mixture over the rolls. I was worried it was way too much at first and left some in the bowl. I was wrong! The topping cooks into the rolls perfectly. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks Lisa!
5,"I have this exact recipe from a neighbor, minus the onion.  Her recipe calls for making this up the day before, covering with foil and refrigerating overnight.  When ready, bake at 350 for 25 minutes with foil on, then uncover and bake an additional 5 minutes.  Always a hit and prep the day before makes it ideal when having company."
5,Great sandwich.  I used 12 regular sized hawaiian rolls and made them up in the morning.  Baked for dinner and they were delicious.  I would suggest covering with foil for at least half of the baking time so that the bun doesn&apos;t dry out.  Thanks Lisa T. for sharing this recipe.  It will be great for summer get togethers and a filling dinner sandwich.  My husband and son each ate 3 - they loved them.
3,"I&apos;ve made these before but grabbed this recipe quickly to make for a party.  After I took them out of the oven I realized I like them better when they&apos;re covered with foil and baked 10 minutes, then remove the foil.  These were okay, but not as good as when they&apos;re covered first."
4,"I made these for NYE and they were a hit!! I didn&apos;t follow the recipe to a T, only because I had a thousand things going on and I screwed up! The must have is King&apos;s Hawaiian rolls. Don&apos;t buy the knock off&apos;s make sure it is that brand, it gives the sandwiches the sweet that everyone loves. The other thing I changed on purpose is I used provolone cheese only because my hubby doesn&apos;t like swiss...but I think it would be good either way. I forgot to add the minced onion and would be good with or without. I also added a little more worcestshire only because I looked at the recipe wrong.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil, put the bottoms of the rolls down first (I did slice them in half while they were all connected like others suggested), I put the cheese next, topped with ham that I doubled over to fit the bun (I used a good maple ham), then I put on the top of the bun. I spooned a tablespoon of the mixture on top of each bun and placed a sheet of foil loosely over the top. The buns were buttery from the mixture and just a little crusty, but nice and soft inside. I did have plenty of butter mixture left over, so I think it is safe to cut back on the butter mixture ingredients or there is plenty to add another 12 sandwiches or so. Yummy! UPDATE: Do not use all of the butter mixture...it makes the rolls too buttery. I would use a teaspoon to drizzle a spoonful on top of each one and probably no more."
4,"Growing up we had a variation of this we called ""poker sandwiches"" because Mom made them when Dad&apos;s friends came over to play poker.  We used yellow mustard, onions, butter and poppy seeds with ham and swiss cheese and made the sandwiches individually with the mustard, onion, butter mixture on the inside of the sandwich.  We wrapped them individually in foil, froze them, and popped them in the oven for poker night.  Our version was always a hit and you can make a ton and keep them on hand for after-school snacks."
5,I have had these sandwiches in the past and they are wonderful. Quick to fix and delicious. Great to serve at a party or small gathering.
5,"First of all I modified the recipe greatly because I didn&apos;t have a few of the ingredients and I had eaten a sweeter version of these in the past and loved them. I also didn&apos;t want all that butter, so I used 1/3 cup of butter, 1 tbsp dijon (I&apos;d add a little more next time), no worcestershire, no poppy seeds, but added 1 tsp of splenda brown a sprinkle or two of tarragon and a pinch of onion powder. I used honey maple ham and muenster cheese and only 16 tea rolls. The tea rolls were great because they were stuck together so I cut all of them in half as one block and assembled the sandwiches in one great square. I put the ham down first, then the cheese and spread a thin layer of may on the top inside so it would melt into the cheese. Then I sliced through them and placed them 1/2"" apart on a foil lined pan. I drizzled each one with a scant tablespoon of the sauce and covered them lightly in with foil because I wanted the rolls to steam a bit. It turned out amazing! The rolls were nicely browned on top and slightly crunchy on the edges and bottom. The sauce flavor was slightly sweet and tangy but not overly rich, perfect! So feel free to reduce the butter :)"
5,"I wanted to have this made before my guests arrived so I put it all together, covered with foil and refrigerated for about 3 hours ... baked for 10 minutes with foil on and 10 minutes with foil off.  I had to substitute sesame seeds for the poppy seeds and omitted the onions.  As suggested in other reviews, I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and added 2 T. brown sugar to the ""sauce"".  Delicious.  Will definitely be making these again.  These were all eaten before I even thought about getting a picture!  Too bad because they looked lovely.  Thanks LisaT for this great twist on ham and cheese sandwiches."
5,"I&apos;ve made these many times and everyone loves them. They are not time consuming at all and can be made up two days before needed. Wash mushrooms and twist out stems. Drain in colander. Put mushroom caps on paper towels to drain well. Slice off woody part of stem and put in food processor. Pulse stems until minced. Add 1 Tlbs olive oil to pan and stir-fry minced stems and garlic (minced type from jar)until dry. Add spices. Slightly cool, but while still warm add  cheeses (and a can of drained crab if want). Put a plastic zip lock bag into a bowl and roll back sides- add cream cheese mixture. Snip off one corner and use as a pastry bag to fill mushrooms. If making ahead 1)use only freshest mushrooms you can find, 2)blot off excess water from mushrooms, 3)put them into a non-metalic dish. I sprinkle the tops with shreded (not grated )parmesan cheese. Cover well with plastic wrap and refrig. until ready to bake. (I&apos;ve made up to two days in advance- without crabmeat though)."
5,"This is a favorite recipe that I have made several times and I never have any leftovers.  Even my young son loves the flavorfull filling. These are great to bring to get togethers.  I usually prepare the stuffing and put into a ziplock and assemble them when I arrive.  Just snip off the corner of the ziplock, fill the mushrooms like a pastry and pop in the oven. Adjustments I make are I add crabmeat to the mixture which I find adds a little more substance to an otherwise very creamy filling.  I like to sprinkle with parmesan cheese before putting them in the oven which adds a nice touch.  A trick I use is to use smaller mushrooms so there is a good balance between mushroom and the amount of filling.  I tried larger ones one time and it almost seemed like each bite was just a bit too full of creamy mixture.  I also lightly butter the mushrooms before baking which keeps them from drying out.  Last trick is I bake them in mini muffin tin pans.  They hold the smaller mushrooms perfectly and the pans keep the mushrooms from tipping over and rolling around.  The cayenne pepper gives just the perfect amount of kick to this recipe."
5,"Great! A little time consuming, but worth it. I, too, added some chopped green onion while sauteeing and lightly brushed outside of mushrooms with melted butter laced with Ital. crumbs. Made almost 3 doz. reg. mushrooms! TIP: slice off bottem a little so they don&apos;t roll over."
5,"Wow, these are ever so good exactly as written!!!  For my family&apos;s personal preference, I added the following....  16 oz of ground sausage, increased the Parmesan to 1/2 cup and the garlic to 1.5 tbsp, and then rolled the top of the stuffed mushrooms in the Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoned Panko bread crumbs prior to baking.  Created a great little crunch with wonderful oozy goodness underneath.  Absolutely divine!!!"
3,"I made for Christmas dinner appetizer and they were YUMMY! But i also read a lot of the reviews and took some of the advice (and left some). I rated accordingly since i changed it a bit. I used 12 large mushrooms (caps about 2"" wide) as the recipe called for as well as the the whole pkg of cream cheese and it was just right. Next time, though, I will use bite size smaller mushrooms but double the amount of mushrooms to make it easier to eat as a appetizer. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and  added to the original ingredients for the filling: 2 stalks green onions (minced and cooked with the garlic and mushroom stems), a bit more parmesan (used fresh grated parmesano reggiano), a bit of garlic powder, 1 crisp, crumbled bacon and about a cup of cooked dungeoness crab. I dunked the mushroom caps in melted butter & lemon before filling, sprinkled with more parmesan and baked in a mini muffin pan. (Beware: if the mushrooms don&apos;t fit all the way into the muffin pan, they will come out shaped like muffins! It is kind of cute though.) Cooked for 20 mins and they came out beautifully! Everyone loved them! The parmesan topping gave it that extra crunch too! And love the heat the Cayenne leaves after you eat it. Will make (my new revised recipe again!) Thanks!"
5,This was my first time making stuffed mushrooms and after reading several of the reviews I decided on how I would make mine. The full amount of cream cheese was enough for 24 mushrooms and I placed a bit of chopped proscuitto in the bottom of each mushroom before placing the cheese mixture on top (which was wonderful). I then sprinkled garlic and herb bread crumbs over them and drizzled melted butter over all. Baked for only 15 minutes and broiled for the last 5. They were wonderful. I plan on making these when my Mom and Grandmom come to visit in the fall. Thanks a bunch!
5,"Excellent recipe.  I doubled the filling and used 24 oz fresh mushrooms and it filled them almost perfectly.  I also added  a dash of Worcestershire sauce while cooking the stems and 1/3 cup of crumbled bacon to the cream cheese mixture.  Just before baking, I sprinkled with breadcrumbs and dipped the mushroom caps in melted butter so that they wouldn&apos;t dry out.  I brought to Thanksgiving as an appetizer and they went in minutes.  Everyone loved the bite that the cayenne pepper added.  Thanks for the great recipe!"
5,"I have made these many times, and they always disappear so fast!  What a great recipe.  I put the stuffing into a ziploc bag with a corner cut off and squeeze it into the caps, it&apos;s less messy.  Thanks for sharing such a great treat!"
5,"Very good recipe! My husband gave it 2 thumbs up, which is HUGE. I followed some other reviewers&apos; suggestions and added 1/4 cup or seasoned breadcrumbs, and cut the cream cheese to about 2/3 what the recipe called for. I also used 2 10oz pkgs of white mushrooms, or about double what the recipe specified. I&apos;m sure adding crabmeat would&apos;ve made it even better, but i don&apos;t think it needs it... i kept the recipe cheap, quick, and easy!"
4,Hubby really liked these. The finely diced onion is very nice. Tip - if the potato mixture will try to stick to your hands when forming the patties. I used an ice cream scoop and wet my hands. Placed a scoop of the mixture onto my wet hand and then gently flattened them into patties. You don&apos;t really need a half cup of oil - just enough to coat the bottom of a heavy non stick skillet.
5,"Used this as a base to expand on....this is what I did/had on hand.  Had about 1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes from the previous night to which I added about 2 Tblsp. green chili sour cream, 2 Tblsp. chopped onion, the egg, a tsp. of a salt/pepper seasoning mix and about 1/2 cup flour (sorry, didn&apos;t measure exactly but added enough to make a somewhat thick (not pourable) batter) and two strips cooked bacon which I had chopped before cooking.  I used the remaining bacon grease, added a bit of cooking oil (not evoo) and about 2 Tblsp. Smart Balance to cook the cakes in.  Used a medium-size cookie scoop to measure and dropped them into the med-hot pan.  When I flipped them, I squished them down.  Will serve with more sour cream.  Have already tried them and they are DElish!  Enjoy!"
5,"I used leftover mashed potatoes and substituted green onions for the onions.  I found two eggs are necessary for 2 cups of potatoes.  Easy and really tasty, too."
5,"O.....M.....G......
                                
                                So good.  So very good.  I made these to serve with roasted chicken/spinach sausages as my spin on ""bangers and mash"".  I know that&apos;s a stretch, but that&apos;s was my inspiration when I decided to serve with sausage.
                                
                                The amount of oil called for is more than what you really need.  I used maybe half and got great results.  I also followed another reviewer&apos;s advice and used half green onion and half yellow onion.  Wow.  The green onion really added something special to what was already a fantastic recipe.
                                
                                Tip:  To make the actual cakes, I used an ice cream scoop and dropped scoops into the skillet (four at a time in a regular size round skillet).  I then sprayed the back of my spatula with cooking spray and flattened them into pancake size without the potatoes sticking to the spatula.  Worked like a charm.
                                
                                I served with roasted chicken and spinach sausages and green beans on the side.  As others suggested, I served the cakes with sour cream.  HEAVENLY.   Thanks for the recipe.  It&apos;s a winner."
4,"I used 3 green onions, and less flour, maybe 3/4 cup. Made one batch and it still very much like fried potatoes and sort of bland. So I added some shakes of garlic powder, paprika, added another egg and some grated cheese in the next batch, which took this to a five star for us. Great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes."
5,My 75 year old mother said they were the best potato cakes she has ever eaten in her life and she has sampled many. I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to flour mixture. I reserved a little of flour mixture to coat outside of cake. I found putting butter on my hands greatly helped to form cakes and keep them from sticking to my hands. I did fry them in one part butter to one part olive oil. Must admit they were pretty awesome. My husband asked that the next time I mash potatoes to make extra so there is plenty left for potato cakes.
5,I shaped these by hand and will use less oil next time (1/2 cup is way too much for these!)  This is a nice way to use up extra mashed  potatoes.  I served them with dollops of sour cream.  I will definitely make them again!
3,"Fine as a base recipe, as I view most recipes. 
                                Several reviews post concerns about being oily and bland but I suggest that these cooks need to mod the recipe to their liking and also understand simple physics and chemistry of cooking.
                                
                                Solution to pancakes being too Oily: First address why you are using the oil. 
                                Thin layer on pan to assist with non-stick: use less oil but more frequently between batches.
                                Thick oil = deep fry or semi-deep fry. More oil+More Heat+Small batches= more stable cooking temperature for more consistent results.
                                Still oily: Your oil temp is not high enough, or you are placing too much in your pan while cooking thus resulting in the temperature of your oil dropping too much to effectively sear the outsides. To oversimplify: the concept of frying is to instantly sear the outsides of your substrate (pancake) keeping the moisture inside and the oil outside. Temp of oil for potatoes should be over 375f but should be under the smoke point of your oil - adjust temps based on your oil selection. Quantity of oil in your pan helps stabilize your temp while placing your batter in the pan.
                                Also remember that your pan also has properties that affect quality. Cast Iron and aluminum have a higher degree of heat radiation than does stainless steel (basic SS only, exceptions for multi-layered pans) meaning that SS does well to sear the outside while Cast Iron or aluminum will cook the inside to a greater degree by providing more heat above the surface of the pan.
                                
                                As"
5,I made these potato cakes to go with roast pork loin and sauerkraut - definitely a winner! I did reduce the flour to 1/2 cup and used less oil as others suggested and these came out perfect. I will probably add a bit more salt and pepper next time. Thanks !!
1,Completely bland and too oily. I would not make these again.
5,"With minor variations this is the recipe I&apos;ve been making for 40 years. It originally came from a home ec teacher and it is beyond awesome.  The differences are, first, that I cream the softened butter with the sugar (not melted). I add 1 tsp. lemon juice with the vanilla, and use 1 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder, and 1-3/4 c. flour. Finally, regardless of how many bananas are used it should equal 1 cup. You will never find a better banana bread, and over the course of 40 years, I&apos;ve never heard differently. Edited 8/17/09: My original 4/14/08 review should have indicated that I mash the bananas, not slice them."
2,"As other reviewers mentioned, it was very moist and the flavor was good.  My only issue was the sight & feel of the bananas in the bread.  Slicing them up, instead of mashing or pureeing them, causes them to be quite mushy and purple.  I felt like I was biting into a bruise each time I ate a slice.  I ended up digging them out before eating in order to salvage the bread.  Sorry, but I think I&apos;ll stick to mashing or pureeing...but I&apos;ll use the rest of this recipe."
3,"This is Martha Stewart&apos;s recipe... only Martha&apos;s says to use room temp. butter.. and suggests using a mixer for the butter and sugar to make it light and fluffy before adding flour and other ingredients, and a full cup of mashed bananas instead of chopped up like Janet says.. more bananas and mashing them is what many of you said you did to tweak this recipe, and it is better that way.  It is a great recipe."
5,"This is quite simply the best banana bread I&apos;ve ever had. I followed the recipe as stated, with a few additions, to enhance the overall flavor of the bread. 
                                
                                I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/8 tsp ground cloves to the batter and 1/2- 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips in addition to the walnuts. Almost all the reviewers agree that the bananas should be mashed, so I mashed them. This distributed the banana flavor evenly throughout the dough. 
                                
                                I also advise against using a mixer for the batter. This would whip too much air into the cake and take away from its dense quality. I baked the bread at 325 and it was perfectly done in an hour and 15 minutes. It cuts easily, thinly and has a great crust. Thank you for a great recipe!"
5,"Just want to chime in here and say that this bread is delicious.  It came out soft and moist (but not underdone) on the inside with a slightly crunchy exterior.  I also left out the nuts with no negative side effects.
                                ....................................
                                The second time I made it (after writing the review), I didn&apos;t have any sour cream, and so I substituted strawberry yogurt.  Just thought I&apos;d mention that it is quite tasty that way, too.  :o)"
5,"This is a wonderful recipe! We are under contract for baking and use it frequently. A couple suggestions...when your bananas are ripening on the counter, throw them into the freezer - skin on! The day you plan to bake, pull them out and allow to partially thaw. All you need to do is cut the top off and squeeze the banana ""pulp"" into your mixing bowl. Sweet and delicious! We also use mini cupcake pans, mini loaf pans, and the new square ""muffin"" pans with this recipe. Adjust your bake time accordingly - approx 15 for mini cakes, and 20 for mini loaves and squares. Perfect with a cold glass of milk or hot coffee or tea! Freeze well!"
5,"This is the best banana bread ever, and i have tried many looking for the best. Two suggestions 1) be sure to let your bananas become fully ripe with lotsa brown on the peel and a little on the fruit  2) i use three bananas for more moist loaf and more robust banana flavor"
5,"With a few slight changes, this was the best banana bread I have ever tasted! First of all, do use room temp real butter and cream it with the sugar. Also, make sure your eggs are room temp. Sift the dry ingredients together and add 1tsp. cinnamon and 1/2tsp. nutmeg. Also make sure you use a full cup of MASHED bananas. With these modifications, you will have the best banana bread on the planet :)"
5,"Excellent recipe and I&apos;m a novice to cooking.  I did substitute the sour cream for lowfat banana yogurt and added a pinch of cinnamon.
                                
                                ADDED:  I noticed I have had this recipe in my allrecipe.com recipe box for almost 10 years.  Still good after all these years."
5,"this had a great ratio of ingredients!  a good tip that i have about cooking sushi rice perfectly if you have a rice cooker is after rinsing your rice, put your hand flat on top of the rice and allow the water to fill until it just covers your hand.  a japanese friend taught me that, and it has turned out perfectly every time, even when my husband does it, and he has much larger hands than I do!"
4,"This recipe has a good ratio of ingredients - I like my rice a bit on the vinegary side, I guess. The only changes I made were to cut out the oil and to add everything to the water in the beginning in stead of cooking the sugar/vinegar mixture seperately. This allows the flavors to really sink in, and it makes the whole process easier, too."
5,"This is a great recipe for sushi rice. Instead of boiling the vinegar/sugar/ salt, I just put it in the microwave for about 1 minute. It comes out the same!"
2,"The rice was cooked well, but it was way too sweet and vinegary for my taste. I could eat sushi rice for a meal, so I was pretty disappointed. I may try it again, but with much less vinegar and sugar. Other recipes that I&apos;ve tried use a fraction of what this one calls for..."
5,"Good recipe.
                                I used a rice cooker as well and I use 1 cup rice for 1 1/4 cup liquid ratio.
                                If you use Kokuho Rose sushi rice you do not have to rinse before cooking."
5,This is really good!! I always use this rice recipe in my sushi rolls and everyone raves about them I HIGHLY recommend this recipe if you are making sushi! (I just bought short-grain rice from my grocery store- they didn&apos;t have sushi rice but I think it is pretty much the same thing. It worked out perfect for me.)
4,"A few tips- if you&apos;re making a larger batch, omit the vegetable oil, and add some slices of orange and lemon, including the rind, to the vinegar mixture.  You&apos;ll also want to add a piece of kelp, if you can find it (try an asian grocery store).   Let that sit overnight so that the flavors can come out.    A good grade of rice is medium grain California extra fancy sushi rice.    When you mix the rice and vinegar mixture together, do it in a wooden bowl (unsealed) with a wooden rice paddle or wide spoon- this helps keep the moisture level in the rice perfect.  If you&apos;re very into making sushi, there are traditional bowls made specifically for this, they look like the bottom part of a wooden barrel and have a metal band going around the side.  You&apos;ll also want to pour the vinegar mixture over a spoon into the cooked rice so that it&apos;s sprinkled evenly, otherwise you&apos;ll end up with clumps of plain rice and this can make it difficult to spread the finished rice onto the nori (sushi seaweed)."
4,I used the suggestion of reviewer JamieS. She was right it did turn out perfectly. I reduced the sugar and vinegar by a smidge and cooked rice in a rice cooker.
5,This was great. I agree it would have been to much vinegar. I did reduce the Vinegar to 1/3 cup and I tasted the rice as I was mixing in the liquid and stopped when it had the right flavor (I didnt use it all). Half of cooking is tasting as you go and this turned out beautifuly for me.
5,"We loved these! Mine did take longer to cook, than stated (about 40 mins. or so), but other than that, they were great. I added a bit of garlic powder to the cheese mixture, just because. I was glad to use up some jalapenos from the garden...I will def be making thiese again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"
5,"Everyone keeps saying they take longer than the recipe states.  This is a very simple fix-I always pre-fry the bacon half way before I wrap the jalapenos.  Then I broil them for 4-5 minutes instead of baking them,  and they are awesome!!!!! People beg me to bring them to get-togethers!!!!"
5,"These were devine. I used November! garden Jalapenos and they were on the small side so I cut the bacon in thirds, just enough to go round and secure with toothpick and I also cooked them longer so the bacon was crisp but boy were they GOOD! This a great little snack to add to other little snacks that you can make ahead of time and serve for company. I NEVER write reviews butyou really have to try these. So much better than the fried poppers."
4,"These are standard but good.  To address some issues:
                                1) If the peppers are too hot, you may not have cleaned the ribs/veins/membranes well enough.  Use a spoon and remove all the ""light green/white"" lines.  This is where the heat is.
                                2) If your cheese is ""melting out"" you didn&apos;t use cream cheese or not enough.  If you want to use just cheddar or another melty cheese, pre-cook the bacon so it is cooked but still limp, then reduce the cooking time in the oven.
                                3) If you like crispy bacon...cooking timn is about 35 mins.
                                4) Feel free to mix other things in with the cheese.  Some barbecue seasonings and garlic salt work well."
5,They did take longer to cook than listed although I like my bacon crisp. I switched to the broiler for 5-10 minutes longer and they were perfect.
5,"Love em!  I use small jalapenos and I substitute jack cheese for the cheddar.  After I slice the peppers, I microwave them for 1 minute, then stuff them.  I cut turkey bacon into thirds and lay it over the top instead of wrapping the pepper because it cooks the bacon more evenly.  You can&apos;t tell the difference between the regular bacon and the turkey bacon once these things are done.  They are DIVINE and it&apos;s the one thing all of my friends ask me to bring to any of our get togethers."
5,Delicious but they cook a little faster if you wrap the halves in bacon instead of putting the halves back together. Worth a try if you&apos;re considering this recipe.
5,"This recipe is awesome and works terrific on the grill! I recommend cooking them in ""halves"" as opposed to putting the halves together (I used just 1/2 bacon slice per 1/2 jalepeno), and this also helps in a faster cooking time. For grilling, I&apos;d also recommend to put toothpicks through each assembled piece to keep the bacon from falling off."
5,I wanted to make a some carb-friendly food for the 48th SB this year and these were a hit. The only real problem that I had is that I did not make enough. I did take the advice of a comment to turn on the broiler on for a few minutes after the time to get crispier bacon I love crispy bacon. I also used 1/2 bacon strips and didn&apos;t put the jalapeno halves back together as the recipe said and instead left them in halves. Great recipie! I will make these again.
1,I have no idea what I did differently than everyone else but these were so hot that we could not eat them. I&apos;m not sure if the jalapenos I bought were another kind of pepper or WHAT. I love jalapeno poppers as an appetizer in a restaurant but these went straight into the garbage. Also the cheese oozed out of most of them because of the extended baking time (35 minutes).
5,"Makes the perfect light appetizer/snack! I took the advice of others & threw in an extra handful of parm, just because i love cheese. I also toasted the bread w/ a drizzle of olive oil & a sprinkle of garlic powder, dried basil & parsley. Irresistable! Thank you!"
5,"Absolutely delicious. I experimented with this several ways, i.e. untoasted bread, toasted, putting the topping on top of untoasted bread and heating all the ingredients. All work but the toasted bread, cool toppings was best in our opinion. I also did a batch omitting the tomatoes and this was great as well. Love this recipe. Plan on making a huge batch and keeping it in the refrigerator for even a quicker appetizer. Very easy and quick. THANK YOU!"
5,"I made this for a bridal shower, and it was a hit.  I prepared the tomato mix the night before and toasted the bread about 15 minutes before the party started.  I liked the cold mix on the warm bread.  I also appreciated that this could be prepared the day before!"
3,"The only real way to serve this without the bread getting moist at all is to deseed the tomatoes and dice up the tomato flesh only. This is the only way that real Italian restaurants would serve it. Rub the sliced bread with a slice of garlic. Lightly toast the bread under a grill. Retreave bread from grill and place toppings on except the olive oil. Lastly, drizzle lightly over all with a little, but good, olive oil. Serve immediately."
5,"I served this at a dinner party last night and everyone loved it!  I had read the ""most helpful"" reviews to get tips and did the following.  Cut Roma tomatoes in half and spoon out seeds.  Lay halves down on paper towels to drain while making and mixing the other ingredients.  I used measurements as per the recipe and I used really good, 18 year aged, balsamic vinegar (that, I think, was key to making this taste so good!).   Next, I chopped tomatoes and mixed everything and refrigerated.  I made the toasted slices by brushing olive oil on them, sprinkling each with garlic powder and Italian herbs, then toasted on a cookie sheet under the broiler.  I let my guests spoon on the brushetta to the toast so they could take as little or much as they wanted.  I noticed the mounds of brushetta grow on their toasts after they tasted it!  Really great recipe; a keeper!"
5,I made this exactly as written except I tripled it(needed to serve 22 people)and it was PERFECT! I served this on Panetini Toast(from Costco). I suggest squeezing most of the liquid out of each tomato before chopping.You don&apos;t want to have too much liquid diluting the ingredients and making the bread soggy.
5,"This is great!  I added 1/2 red onion though...and it was just enough.  Also, I spooned the mixture onto the slices bread and baked it in the oven for 10 minutes...perfect.  Enjoy!"
5,"Great Recipe.  I disagree with those who advise others to seed the tomatoes.  The true flavor of the bruschetta is on the ""sauce"" that forms from the tomatoes&apos;juices, olive oil, and seasonings marinating together.  To keep the bread from getting soggy, make sure it is well toasted, and use a slotted spoon to serve, if desired.  At our house, we fight for those last juices--to sop them up with a crusty baguette is Heaven!"
5,"This was really good although it was a little bland - I threw in some balsamic viniagrette in the morning and it was awesome.  I used this in a sandwich with really good ciabatta bread, proscuitto, and fresh mozzarella.  Mmm."
5,"I&apos;ve tried a few Spinach and Artichoke dips from this site and I&apos;ve loved them all but this is BY FAR my favorite! It is just perfect, and delicious! I used Sour Cream instead of mayo and it was PERFECT!! YUM!!! I used 2 cloves of garlic, did without the basil. I also used Whipped Cream Cheese, it is so much easier to work with. I mixed the shredded cheese into the mixture, much better that way than on top! I thought it got yucky if you put it on top. A hard layer and impossible to dip in. I serve with tortilla chips and baguette. I even mix it all together the day before and put it in a pan in the fridge and then when I&apos;m ready to bake it I throw it in the oven! I make this and bring it whenever I&apos;m going to someone&apos;s house and EVERYONE loves it. I can&apos;t even tell you how many times I&apos;ve been asked for this recipe, EVERY time I make it! LOVE IT!"
5,"This is another fabulous version of the spinach/artichoke dip.  However, I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise - much better! We use a bag of frozen spinach (rather than the boxes or fresh) and just squeeze it dry - the spinach quality is better.  You can really add a little of whatever you&apos;d like, and it is ALL good! I added chives to add some more green to it. I also have added a few dashes of Frank&apos;s hot sauce (which does not overwhelm the other flavors - just enchances them!). You can toss in bacon bits, chopped garlic, chopped red peppers (not green - ew!), etc. Be sure to really chop up the spinach and artichokes - no big chunks for this dip please.  You could toss in regular onions too, but I think it is great without them.  It does take a little longer to bake with the sour cream - and I use a 9x13 glass pan, so you can see the edges getting golden!  I buttered the edges of the pan last tmie - OGM - the dip was gone in under two hours!  This is a keeper, and has been a request since we first made it . YUM!!!!  (We use Ritz crackers,but this is good on Ritz, tortilla chips - almost anything!)  If you have any left over, it is just as good warmed up in the microwave the next day.  (I think we&apos;ve had leftovers ONCE!)  Rich, so you don&apos;t want to eat it all the time, but if you want a great dip - go for the best!  (No cartons of liquidly sour cream junk when this is so easy to make!)"
5,"LOVE IT! I used light cream cheese (16oz instead of just 8oz) jarred minced garlic instead of wasting my time mincing it myself and I used more spinach than called for to ensure this was actual spinach dip and not just a cream cheese dip (I posted a picture). I also mixed the mozzarella in with everything else instead of just putting it on the top. I paired this with the ""Pita Chips"" recipe on this site submitted by Dawn. The two are match made in heaven! I cannot speak highly enough about this recipe. Thanks a bunch!"
5,"This is the best Artichoke and Spinach Dip in the world! Once we discovered how great the recipe was, I made it two more times that week! My mother came over and we made double the amount and ate it with water crackers while drinking pina coladas and playing scrabble. We hardly played at all, though. We couldn&apos;t stop eating that dip! I think this is a fantastic recipe, but for our tastes I added a tsp. of cayenne pepper and a little more garlic. Wonderful dip!"
5,I love artichokes and cheese but hate spinach. I have to admit I could not stop eating this dip. I made it for a New Year&apos;s party and thank goodness I doubled the recipe. I served it with parmesan-garlic toast rounds and Triscut crackers. It was a H-I-T. A bit on the expensive side but well worth it when the compliments start pouring in. One hint: Mix most of the mozarella into the dip and sprinkle just enough on the top to brown and present nicely. This makes the taste great and when it cools you have no hard layer to fight with to get to the dip.
5,"I fixed this as an appetizer for our Labor Day cookout and it was amazingly good. One of my teenagers, that hasn&apos;t eaten anything green in years, was actually eating the bread bowl when the dip was finished. I did take other reviewers advice and made a few changes: substitute sour cream for mayo, increase garlic to 3 cloves, mix mozzarella in before baking, and serve in a bread bowl. Everyone just raved about this dip and it disappeared quicK!"
5,Wow.  Made this for my mother in law who loves this stuff.   She went for a second helping and that is unusual for her.  This is by far the best recipe I have found for this.  The only change I made was to use fresh mozzarella instead of shredded...melts creamier.  Thank you for the post.
5,"Omigod this is FANTASTIC!  I&apos;ve made it over 5 times, and every single time the serving bowl is wiped clean!  You&apos;ll need about 3 baguettes per recipe, sliced about 1"" thick, if that&apos;s how you want to serve it.  I also normally make double batches since the package of frozen spinach at the store is enough for 2 recipes (I hate to waste it), and always add a little more of the cheese, spices, & garlic.  Also, if you use the artichoke hearts from Costco, they have an irresistable flavor and are marinated in olive oil & herbs (which helps enhance the flavor of the dip)--plus, you can steal pieces and still have enough in the jar for your recipe!  Just FYI, a double batch fits perfectly in a 9x9 pyrex dish, so you can just bake it, throw the plastic lid on & it&apos;s easy to transport to your next party!"
5,this was soooooo good! i will not order artichoke & spinach dip in a restaurant when i can make this at home. i followed the recipe except that i didn&apos;t have garlic salt---just garlic powder---and it turned out well. i also added more mozarella---i like it extra cheesy. great recipe...will definitely make this again:)
3,my boyfriend loves spinach artichoke dip and he wasn&apos;t too impressed with this. sorry!
5,"I am the poster of this recipe. Thank you all for such nice reviews. You can CUT CALORIES CONSIDERABLY by spraying them with a mister or PAM(TM). I use a ""Misto""(TM) filled with olive oil. Also, you can decrease the salt and add additional seasonings. Enjoy!!  UPDATE: The timing of the baking, as others noted, is critical. Baking too little results in limp kale pieces and baking too long causes a ""burned"" taste. Be sure to use the ""curly"" kale variety as it tend to be less bitter.DO NOT EXPECT them to taste like potato chips... that was just an expression I used in the description. Kale is a nutritional powerhouse and rich in calcium and other vitamins. GREAT way to feed yourself and your kids!! ENJOY!!"
5,"I&apos;ve tried a LOTS of versions of kale chips with LOTS of different results. I&apos;ve found that the success of the chip depends on three things: how you cook them, how curly the kale is and how much oil you use.   This method has been, by far, the best: I&apos;ve tried lower temp with long cooking, higher temp with quick cooking, convection methods, different sheet pans and all the rest. This recipe works (IMHO) by using a non insulated sheet and cooking at 350 for 10 minutes. I rotated my baking sheet 180 halfway through.   I also made a point to use ONLY just enough oil to BARELY coat the leaves otherwise they&apos;ll stay soggy. When I arrange the pieces on the pan, I place them like little upside down ""V&apos;s"" so the curly side is down: I think this helps the air circulate around them better.   Other than that, after you coat them with the oil, get creative with the toppings!!! I squeeze a little lemon on mine with sea salt or will do some garlic powder with chipotle pepper powder.   Hope you&apos;ll all enjoy these as much as I did...Thanks Lucy!"
5,"My hubby looked at me like I was crazy when I started making this! LOL We both really liked the finished product. I used butter flavored cooking spray because it seemed easier than spreading the oil around and also used garlic salt which we really liked! The only hint I can offer is to watch this very, very carefully toward the end of the cooking time because I think just thirty seconds past ""crispy"" is another term...""crumbly"" Into tiny pieces that are messy to eat :o)"
5,"These were really neat.  They did have a similar taste to potato chips.  I made mine a little too salty but they were great.  Even the kids ate them, which is saying something for kale."
5,I got this recipe from a local blogger who writes about our local box. She used soy sauce instead of the seasoning salt and they came out heavenly.
5,"So. Very. Good.
                                
                                I&apos;ve been looking to an alternative to munching chips in front of the TV at night, and these are awesome, especially when you&apos;ve had enough hummus for the week:). 
                                
                                For those who were concerned about the ultra-crunchy crumbliness, (which in truth I kind of liked) I found that those Kale leaves that were folded in two (as it tends to do by itself if you don&apos;t unfold it as you place it on the pan) were a little more crunchy on parts and chewier in parts, if that&apos;s what you&apos;re going for. I had a mix of both and loved it. 
                                
                                I kept a close eye on these and ended up happier with a tad lower temperature (around 330-340) and set the timer for 6 minutes and checked them, the first batch ready in 7 min, the second in 6 (hotter oven I guess). 
                                
                                Halfway through eating these, I called my sister in law and HAD to tell her about them. Definitely a find. I will make these at my next family gathering. (My nephews and nieces have come to expect my unusual &apos;hippie&apos; food:) )"
2,"I was very excited to see this recipe, but disappointed by the finished product. It was definitely not a hit with my kid. They were difficult to cook evenly. It was a fine line between crispy and burnt. My husband and I thought they were ok, but not something we are excited to try again. You end up with a lot of chips and they really don&apos;t keep - you need to eat them right away or they are quite unpleasant. I did make a vegetarian lasagna with kale a few days later (we have a lot of kale these days) and that was a big hit."
5,"I love these. Important tips: Wash and thoroughly dry. If possible, dry the day prior. I place the kale in a extra large bowl, add oil and shake until each piece is covered with oil. After laying them out on a cookie sheet, I lightly salt. Baking time is crucial. If unsure on time, go with low and slow. Brown make bitter! I do 325 for about 15-20 min, depending on moisture. 
                                For extra flavor, sprinkle parmesan cheese, crushed red chili, dry ranch mix or during shake process add vinegar of choice for tartness!"
4,These are indeed a good conversation item. They all got eaten but it took a few days. I&apos;ll make these again and this time will not stir in the middle of the baking time (it seemed like a good idea but the kale stuck together).
5,I make this recipe at least once a holiday season. Not only is it good as an appetizer my family likes to have them for breakfast. When I make this I like to use my own homemade baking mix and a mixture of sharp cheddar and pepperjack cheeses. They always get inhaled in this house!
2,"To be fair, I will preface my review and say that I did not use the specific brand of sausage which apparently affected the outcome dramatically. I used Owen&apos;s. The proportions of this recipe created little hard dry balls with almost no meat. I cooked about a dozen as a test run, knowing something looked wrong, and they were OK hot, but as soon as they cooled, they were stones.  So, to the remainder of my mix,  I added a 3rd pound of sausage and they turned out great.  If you look at other sausage ball recipes, you&apos;ll see the usual ratio of bisquick to sausage is 2:1, not 3:1."
4,"Always enjoy these when family is in town.  Used this recipe more as a guide, using 2c mix, 12 oz sausage and 8oz cheese and added half cup milk."
4,"As the recipe was written I wasn&apos;t sure if I was supposed to cook the sausage first like most other recipes. I cooked the sausage first and then mixed the ingredients but the ""dough"" wasn&apos;t sticking together. So I added 4 eggs to the mix and that made it stick. They expanded and in the end not in a ball shape more like a biscuit. My husband thought they turned out similar to the biscuit at Red Lobster."
3,"Well, I wanted to give it high marks, but 6 cups of Bisquick is WAY too much.  I reduced it to about 3 1/2 for the 2 lbs of sausage and 2 lbs of cheese and added a bit of chicken broth just to make it easier to mix everything together.  I also think raising the temp to 325 would be better.  Several of the helpful hints that I read in different reviews include:  line a cookie sheet with foil and use a baking rack so the grease drips onto the foil during cooking (that&apos;s gotta reduce the calorie count a little, right?), and use disposable latex gloves to mix ingredients together, and finally, use block cheese and grate it yourself.  After those adjustments, the sausage balls turned out to be excellent."
5,Been making these for years. They are meant to be firm. Sausage should be uncooked when mixing. The ingredients should be mixed well until they become a paste-like dough. If your ingredients aren&apos;t sticking it means the sausage has not been thoroughly incorporated. Use your hands and mix and knead until you get that paste. Pull off smaller portions to make smaller balls. Golf ball size makes more of a biscuit than a ball. Recipe perfect as is if you do the required mixing.
3,I too made this recipe and found it difficult getting ingredients to stick together. Seemed like it was too much biscuit mix so I added 2 eggs and a little milk (1/2 cup) to moisten it. Seemed like it needed a little more sausage in the recipe as it was a bit bready.
5,So easy and delicious. My family ate the whole batch when I turned my back.
4,add the cheese after mixing the sausage and the Bisquick.
5,These are great! Accidentally used reduced fat wafers but they turned out perfectly using this recipe as written. Can’t wait to give some as gifts.
3,The flavor is good but the shaping has been difficult. The material winds up rather crumbly and I&apos;m not sure how to fix it
5,These were awesome!  I had bought a bottle of Skrewball whiskey several months ago and this was the perfect use for it.  I wasn&apos;t sure how they would come out so I halved the recipe but now I&apos;m wishing I made the full amount!
5,"It is awesome.  Tastes like Reese&apos;s Peanut Butter cups with a kick.  I had to halve the peanuts because I did not want to risk my husband having any difficulty with the nuts.  He has to be careful, so I ground them up really, really fine, and used half the amount.  I doubled the peanut butter to compensate.  I even had some really old whiskey around, and I used that in order to NOT have to go to the store for special peanut butter flavored whiskey.  I figured with the extra peanut butter, I did not need it.  But they turned out absolutely fabulous!!!!  Truly, these are to die for."
4,"I&apos;m Vietnamese so I was impressed when I saw such a great version of one of my favorite dishes.  For those of you who are willing to add a bit more effort to make the rolls even that much more ""authentic"" here are some suggestions:  along with the shrimp, add some boiled pork that&apos;s thinly sliced. As well as some sprouts, shredded carrot and a long thinly sliced piece of cucumber.  
                                
                                And for an easy and excellent peanut dipping sauce, mix 1 part crunchy peanut butter to 2 parts hoisin sauce.  Whisk over medium heat until blended, adding a few splashes of water to make the sauce less thick.  This sauce truly MAKES the dish!  Hope this was helpful!"
5,"This was so similar to a cooking class recipe that I lost that I just had to try it.  I simplified the recipe by mixing the softened rice noodles with fish sauce (for flavor), and omitting the basil and mint.  I added grated fresh carrots to the rolls for extra color and flavor.  One of the tips I learned in the cooking class was to layer the ingredients for color and a good presentation.  On the bottom end of the softened wrapper, place a leaf of lettuce, cut into two pieces, so that it lies flat.  Top with shredded carrots, then rice noodles, then cilantro leaves.  Just above this stack of ingredients, lay the split shrimp in a line.  By doing this, the shrimp will be visible through the transparent wrapper, when the rolls are served.  Diagonally slice off the uneven ends of the roll, and make a diagonal cut through the roll, dividing it into two pieces.  By doing this, the beautiful green, orange, and white fillings are displayed.  
                                
                                I served my rolls with a peanut dipping sauce.  It was very, very good!  The next day, I mixed the leftover rice noodles with fish sauce, shredded carrots, cooked shrimp, cilantro, peanut sauce, and chopped lettuce for a tasty and easy cold main dish."
5,"These fresh spring rolls are delicious!  Don&apos;t be intimidated by the rice paper wrappers.  Soak them one at a time in warm water until they are JUST soft then remove it to a paper towel and fill.  The wrap will continue to soften.  By the time you are finished adding the ingredients, it will be ready to roll. If you don&apos;t have ALL the ingredients called for in this recipe, please don&apos;t let that stop you from using what you do have and enjoying every bite."
5,"Spring rolls are my absolute favorite Vietnamese food.  Apparently, people have different versions of the dipping sauce.  In our family (and yes, we&apos;re Vietnamese), we make a peanut-hoisin dipping sauce.  We NEVER use a fish sauce for spring rolls.  In a sauce pan, heat up one can of coconut soda (don&apos;t worry if you can&apos;t find this, I&apos;ve subbed a can of 7-up or Sprite with the same result albeit with a slightly different taste), about 3 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter, and about 6 tablespoons of hoisin sauce.  Whisk until all the peanut butter melts.  Simmer.  (Taste it & add more hoisin or peanut butter to suite your tastebuds.)  Put a tablespoon of cornstarch into a mug, add water, & mix.  Slowly add this to the simmering pot to thicken the sauce to your desired consistency - the sauce should have a consistency like gravy.  This will make lots of sauce.  Cool before serving.  Top with crushed peanuts.  In our family, 8 spring rolls does NOT equal 8 servings.  Seriously, we each eat 3-4 of these as a meal.   So that&apos;s enough sauce for everyone (well, sometimes, because some of us like the sauce so much, we practically drink the sauce!) UPDATED NOTE:  I made 40 of these today for our party.  When we make lots of these, it helps to take all the greens and chop it all up together; then I can grab 1 handful and get all the veggies at once.  Also, we use slivered cucumbers - adds an extra crunch. Cucumber slices + peanut-hoisin sauce = heaven!  Trust me on that one."
5,"Brought this to a neighborhood gathering and simplified it since I only had a few minutes to get it ready.  I bought the rice vermicelli and rice wrappers at the local asian store.  I also found rib eye very thinly sliced which is usually used for Korean bulgogi.  I marinated the beef in the soy and ginger rib eye marinade I also found on this website (I added more soy sauce and red pepper to the original recipe to add a bit of kick to it.)  Instead of getting all the different herbs, I grabbed a fancy salad mix with baby spinach, arugula and radicchio.  I stirfried the beef, boiled the water for the vermicelli and then saved that same hot water to put the rice wrappers in one by one to soften.  These rolls disppeared first off the picnic table - perfect for a warm summer evening.  So many people asked me for the recipe and they couldn&apos;t believe that I did this all within half an hour!"
5,"So delicious!
                                
                                If unable to find Thai basil, just add more cilantro and mint.
                                
                                Method for softening Rice Paper:  alternate between sheets of wet paper towels.  Within 3 minutes they will be soft enough to handle but not so soft that they disintegrate.
                                
                                Method for rolling:When rolling, don&apos;t start by covering the contents then pulling in.  Rather, cover half the contents, then pull in and roll.  This makes them firmer, and a lot easier to eat."
5,"These rolls were great the same day I made them.  They still tasted good the next day, but they started to get a little sticky.  If you are serving them to company, make them fresh."
5,"An explosion of flavour!
                                My suggestions:
                                Soak the rice &apos;Angel Hair&apos; noodles in hot water until soft and white, if you boil them, they turn out soggy. Rinse the noodles in cold water, drain and they are done. Don&apos;t chop the herbs up, use whole leaves. Too easy to use too much if it&apos;s all chopped up. People have teeth! They can chew!
                                The wrappers need to be simply dipped into warm water, one at a time, and taken out. Place on a clean, plastic cutting board. They will still be hard. Do not fret! By the time you have put the ingredients on, they will have softened up!
                                Think of the centre of the rice paper wrapper as the &apos;top&apos; of the finished roll. Place six shrimp halves (or sliced chicken, pork or tofu pieces) pink side down in a horizontal line. Around this place 6-10 cilantro leaves flat on the wrapper so they show through. On top of the shrimp/meat/tofu place the mint leaves and the basil leaves. Then an oblong nest of noodles. Then some shredded carrot and mung bean sprouts. (Forget the lettuce.) Finally some paper-thin slices of unpeeled English (hothouse) cucumber. You will have a manageable shape that is easier to roll. Roll up as you would do a burrito. Beautiful!
                                I use a dipping sauce that is 2 parts smooth peanut butter, 1 part Hoisin sauce, whizzed with 4-6 cloves fresh garlic, a splodge of chili-garlic sauce, a lot of fresh lime juice and a bit of cold water to thin out.
                                Note! These &apos;&apos;Rouleaux de Printemps&apos;&apos; are NEVER deep-fat fried!"
3,"I believe you are missing a few things, but it&apos;s ok overall. Carrot or jicama or even daikon for crunch is much needed in your recipe. I would double the shrimp in your rolls, so every bite has some shrimp in it. Also, your hoisin based sauce is the more appropriate one, but you should add some peanut butter and water to it, to give it better depth of flavor. The hoisin by itself can be a bit overpowering."
5,"Glad you are all enjoying this recipe.  Just wanted to mention a few things in response to some reviews.  First, I mix all ingredients in the pan I melt the butter in. Less dishes. Second, I often use whole wheat flour to cut sweetness and make it a tad more healthy.  Third, it freezes fabulously.  I always make a double batch, remove one from the pan after cooling, wrap it up and pop it in the freezer.  Thanks for all the rave reviews!
                                
                                3/20  Based on some reviews I&apos;ve read, I want to clarify something.  I use a regular pot to melt my butter in.  After the butter has melted I proceed with adding the rest of the ingredients in that same pot.  I do NOT get a separate bowl for mixing in.  After all the ingredients are mixed in the pot I pour the batter into a baking pan.  I do NOT mix everything in the pan I&apos;m baking it in.  I do NOT keep the butter and sugar mixture out when mixing the rest of the ingredients.  Hope that helps. 
                                
                                7/24/10  I&apos;d change the recipe if I could, but I can&apos;t figure out how, so I&apos;ll mention here that the normal baking time is 30 minutes.  I put 30-40 minutes in the directions because it takes longer when you use whole wheat flour, which I often do.  I&apos;m guessing those who complain about it being dry are just seeing the ""cook time - 40 minutes"" at the top and overbaking it.
                                
                                3/16/11  I never claimed this was a Southern recipe & couldn&apos;t figure out why some reviews pointed out that it wasn&apos;t. Evidently Allrecipes put it in that category.  Sorry!"
4,"Very good recipe though I tweaked it a bit.  I reduced the sugar a little, but think it would be fine for the full amount if you like your cornbread a little sweet.  I used powdered buttermilk and water and added 2/3 c. fresh yellow corn.  In my opinion, the ONLY way to cook cornbread is in a preheated cast iron skillet.  It gives it such a wonderful buttery, crisp crust.  I greased my 9 in. skillet with vegetable oil and put it in the oven while I assembled the recipe. When the batter was finished, I poured it into the hot skillet.  I then baked it for 25 minutes.  The result was top notch.  Very moist with perfect texture."
5,"Awesome 5++ stars. To the readers who had dry bread.... 1/4 lb not 1/4 cup butter!!! This might have made a difference if you read it wrong, 1/4 lb is 1/2 cup of butter. Also I put it in my greased preheated iron skillet for 25 min, excellent!!"
5,"I made twelve, gorgeous muffins with this recipe and they were not sweet, not dry, and certainly not ""cake-like.""  I don&apos;t like too sweet ANYTHING and even tho&apos; I was tempted to reduce the sugar after reading some of the reviews, sheer curiosity led me to prepare the entire recipe, including the amount of sugar, as is.  Normally I find that I want honey, butter (or both!) on my cornbread, but not this time.  These muffins were buttery, moist, just slightly sweet, hearty and surprisingly flavorful.  They baked up nicely with perfectly risen tops at 375 degrees for about 22 minutes. I swear, once again it&apos;s the buttermilk - and the butter, of course!"
5,"The recipe is fantastic as written, but after making this recipe a few times I made a few changes.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose, Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and sour skim milk instead of buttermilk.  Sounds like a lot of substitutions, but the end result was absolutely delicious, and nearly guilt free!  This is the ONLY cornbread recipe that I use, and it comes out wonderful every time."
5,"Really good and easy. Tip: if you don&apos;t have buttermilk, decrease the milk by 2 tablespoons, and replace with 2 tablespoons lemon juice. It was a little on the sweet side, I will decrease the sugar a bit next time, as I am trying to decrease the sugar in my familys diet. It held together nicely when sliced, a bonus with messy youngsters :)"
4,"If you are a southerner and like the non-sweet, buttery-tasting southern style corn bread, this is not for you. But if you like the sweeter, more cakelike cornbread served in New England and other areas, you&apos;ll adore this recipe. Try it for breakfast with butter and maple syrup!"
1,No true Southerner puts sugar in the cornbread.  The secret of Southern cornbread is to heat the fat in a skillet and pour the batter into the hot skillet.
5,"Fabulous! Great flavor and just the right amount of sweet.  (I like it sweet!) Like Jiffy mix except it holds together GREAT, and no bitter chemical aftertaste.  Just loved this.  Also, it was so easy to make, not much more work than a mix anyway!  I followed Bethany&apos;s advice and mixed it in the pan I baked it in, but it was so hard to be careful to not slop everything out while stirring together to me it is definitely worth one more dish to mix together in a bowl next time! Thanks for a great recipe!  I won&apos;t be buying those chemically mixes any more! :)
                                
                                (I used 1 c milk and took out 1 TB and added 1 TB apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk, let sit 5 mins, worked great.)"
5,"I made some changes to this recipe because I didn&apos;t have an onion.  I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard, a teaspoon of lemon juice, half a teaspoon of black pepper, two tablespoons of sour cream, and a dash of tabasco.  The patties came out delicious, and I am giving this recipe five stars because it provides a great base that you can personalize to your taste."
4,"These hit the spot!  I&apos;ve been craving salmon patties so I guess I must need the omega 3&apos;s.  I looked in some old cookbooks and salmon cans used to be 16 ounces then, 15 something, and now they&apos;re 14 something.  (Trivia!)
                                
                                I loved the reviews, and joined this web site to do this one!  This is my first review, woo hoo! I implemented the sour cream and garlic salt suggestion.  I also added a little lemon pepper. I ended up adding another egg and some more bread crumbs to make them stick together better.  My bread crumbs were the ""Italian Style"" seasoned kind ""Vigo"" is the brand name with Romano cheese!  Mmmmm I buy the honking huge container from Sams club. 
                                
                                My batch made six hamburger size patties and I first tried frying them with a few squirts of Pam.  They got too brown before they got done all the way through = no good.  The next batch I fried in about a quarter inch of corn oil and they turned out great!  Well of course, because they were more fattening!  I drained them on paper towels and served them with cocktail sauce.  My husband said that his mother used to make them smaller and thinner (Hint hint!).  She was the best cook ever and as a wedding present she taught me how to make real biscuits and gravy.  (May she rest in peace.)  Anyway, next time I&apos;ll make 12 smaller thinner patties with the same recipe."
4,"This recipe is so easy and quick to make.  My nine year old daughter even likes this.  She did like it better when I made it with cracker crumbs rather than bread crumbs.  If you&apos;re not a fish person (I&apos;m definitely not), I&apos;d suggest you buy the salmon that comes in a tuna-sized 3 oz. can.  I bought ""traditional"" salmon in a big can and was grossed out by it.  It literally looked like a salmon had been cut down to size and stuffed in a can, skin, bones and all.  I threw it away and couldn&apos;t bring myself to eat it. The little cans are boneless/skinless and look like the tuna I&apos;m used to seeing."
5,"Very good and easy.  I added about 1 tsp of Old Bay and some fresh grated garlic.  Made a dipping sauce of 1 cup sour cream, about 1 T of lemon juice and 1 tsp dill weed.  (Adjust measurements to your taste.)  Everyone in the family loved these.  Can&apos;t wait to make them. again."
4,"I honestly have not made this particular recipe, but with one exception, it has all the same ingredients as my mom&apos;s salmon patties and we all just love them.  
                                
                                The one exception is that we use crushed saltine crackers for the bread crumbs.  It adds a lot of good flavor.
                                
                                Another suggestion - mom always served hers with a sauce made from a can of cream of mushroom soup, thinned with about a quarter cup of milk.  She then diced one or two hard boiled eggs and stirred them into the sauce.  I&apos;m so used to having this sauce that I won&apos;t make the patties now if I don&apos;t have cream of mushroom soup in the house!"
5,"so simple yet so good!!!
                                a great basic recipe...i added 1 tbs lemon juice, a sprinkling of pepper, prarika and served it with thai sweet chilli sauce and wasabi mayonaise!! Yum!!"
4,"Try using very fine bread crumbs called Panko.  It is in the Asian aisle.  I don&apos;t know what makes this brown so evenly but it does if you do not heat the oil too hot.  Use Canola oil heated slowly and fry at medium heat.  Also, shred yellow squash & zuchini to the mixture.  Red pepper chopped adds color.  I served with wasabi mayo.  Wasabi is traditionally hot but added to mayo keeps it tame.  Some Asian markets sell there own version.  I prefer to make into rounded balls I think because it cooks so evenly and quicker than a patty."
4,"I went the Pam route on this recipe in a non-stick pan and had absolutely no trouble with it. The patties browned and did not stick. I adjusted the recipe for health&apos;s sake using eggbeaters, and whole wheat bread crumbs with my own seasoning, and a little parsley. Very tasty and easy."
3,I changed this redcipe to fresh mashed salmon - There is a world of differnce with fresh.  I sauteed the 1 LB FRESH salmo to get hte skin off & mashed it up & added minced fresh galrlic (1 clove) & (1TBSP-parsley & (2 TBSP-celery)  & )1/4 C-onion - sdded the Egg & Breadcrumbs - & brownwed in a frypan with a little oil.
5,It was awesome but I added 1/4 cup louisiana chicken wing sauce and 1 teaspoon of onion powder. Best wings yet
5,"Cooked in slow cooker for 2 hours. I used the same amount of oil and spices but only 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs. It turned out very good and it was so simple!"
4,the recipe turned out exactly as promised.  It was really delicious! A big hit with everyone!
5,"I used 2 Tbsp olive oil, plenty of minced garlic, 2 Tbsp Frank&apos;s hot sauce, and the called for amounts of everything else. Oh, and a tsp of onion powder.  I marinated the wings in all of the above for 2 hours, then baked them on my tin-foil-covered cookie sheet for just under an hour.  My buffalo-wing-loving husband said he definitely wants me to make them again. (His rating was 4 1/2 stars, because he&apos;d never give anything a ""perfect score""...but for him, this is as close as it gets. :)  The skin had just the right crispness, but the meat was definitely not dried out.  We had ranch, more Frank&apos;s hot sauce, and celery on the side."
5,My mom makes these wings all the time and the other day I got a huge craving for them and couldn&apos;t get a hold of her for the recipe. Thankfully it was right here! I also used this for drum sticks and they came out great and in the same amount of time. I also put some wing sauce on some after I took them out and that made them even better.
4,My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing that I would do differently is allow the chicken to marinate for a few hours before cooking.
5,My husband LOVED these wings! I didn&apos;t get to try any myself because I was dieting but when I asked him what he thought of them he told me they were they were the best he&apos;s had!
5,"I ate more of these than I should have. Easy.  Will recommend these ones to a couple of people.  YUMMY YUMMY, I had too many chicken wings in my tummy."
4,"Great!  My husband hates bake chicken, but I convinced him that these wouldn&apos;t be the same and he loved them.  I&apos;m"
3,Easy and pretty tasty but nothing special.
5,Great and simple. A word of warning: Do NOT use a smokey BBQ sauce with lil smokeys.  Use a sweet bbq sauce.
5,"I have been making these for years.  The only thing I do differently is mix equal parts grape jelly, BBQ sauce and ketchup.  This also works just as well with cut up beef hot dogs.  Adults and kids alike love these.  I love them especially because they&apos;re fast, easy and can be prepared in advance."
5,I have been making these for parties for years!  People can&apos;t seem to get enough of these.  I always use apricot jelly but I&apos;m sure grape works just fine too.  These little things seem to be addictive no matter how you make them.
5,"I have been making this for 15 years. My x-wife had this recipe. Funny to see it again here. Nobody believs me when I say I used grape jelly in it. I take it to pot lucks all the time and it is one of the first dishes to go. Just took it to a b day party last month and when my girlfriend saw me putting grape jelly in with the links a sause, she grosed out and said no way she would eat it, and that I ruined the links she spent all that money on. After hearing all the great revievs from party goers she decided to give it a shot. She loved it!"
5,u can also make this with a jar of chili sauce and a can of thanksgiving cranberry jelly.  both are also good with little cocktail sized meatballs.  i too agree how addictive this recipe is!
5,A household hit for any occaision! I use equal parts of grape jelly and BBQ sauce. I also make this with prepared meatballs from the grociery store. This is also good using both meatballs and lil smokies. Just make sure the sauce covers the meat. This gives a little more variety when making for a party.
4,This is in the crockpot as we speak. It&apos;s not a holiday without these wonderful little gems. I did saute a little onion and garlic in butter then added the grape jelly and my own homemade barbeque sauce and peppered it up a bit before pouring over the Lil&apos; Smokies. OMNOM.
5,I was very skeptical about this recipe so I tested it first. Funny how the taste changes as it cooks. After an hour the smoky flavor from the bbq sauce was so overwhelming I thought this was a big mistake but after 2 hours the smokiness was slight and balanced and delicious. I couldn t believe it. I reheated them the next day in the microwave oven and they were still perfect. Strange but this works!
5,I love these little yummy appetizers and have eaten many sauce variations but my favorite is a combination of grape jelly catsup pineapple a little sugar and......diced jalapenos!
1,"These did NOT taste good. I used Famous Dave&apos;s Sweet N Sassy with grape jelly over miniature buffalo sausages. I wasted a bunch of sausages and had to come up with a ""plan B"" for my party. Will use a recipe with ingredients that aren&apos;t so bizarre. The grape jelly was just too much."
4,"I tried it the first time &apos;as is,&apos; which I believe is necessary when reviewing a recipe. They were fine but browned too fast and were chewy. Based on that and other people&apos;s reviews, I made the following adjustments: a) only 1 tbl of sugar in the dough (cuts the browning); b) only 1 tbl of oil in the dough (cuts the chewiness). It should be noted that you only need to mix dry with wet for 30 sec. I also used a churreria, which ensures the right thickness and was brilliant. Made these finger sized with only 5 in the pan at a time - putting too many in the pan lowers the temp of the oil & will cause you to cook them long after they&apos;re brown or remove them while still raw. Take them out to drain, put the next batch in the fryer and shake the cooling (now warm not hot) ones in a paper bag with the sugar and cinnamon; a second person is not needed. I would recommend doubling the recipe for anyone wanting to serve more than 2-3 people without having to double the sugar/cinnamon coating. Halve the sugar/cinna mix if only making one batch. Real churros in Spain are not light and fluffy; they&apos;re like this. All in all, a good recipe. :)"
5,"Easy recipe Delia!  My husband thought it was difficult to make.  Did not have a pastry bag, so I used a ziploc bag instead to pipe into oil.  I had no problems at all."
5,"These were GREAT!  I should have doubled the recipe because it turned out they were not enough, hehe.  Make sure you fry them till they are a golden brown, they don&apos;t come out as chewy.  I used my Pampered Chef Easy Accent Decorator with the largest flower tip attachment, they were thin but they were so yummy and cute!  Also, if you don&apos;t mess with them until they are ready to be turned, they shouldn&apos;t fall apart."
5,"These are splendid.  I used a pastry bag but beware, the dough is hot and my bag split in the middle of squeezing them in the hot greese. An electric skillit / fryer would be best to keep a constant temp.  I hand rolled some but they were not nearly as good as the ones I used with the pastry bag. I used a wilton #25 but need one a bit bigger. You must work quickly as the dough will go cement quickly. Also be sure to wash up your bowl and dough tools ASAP."
5,These are very good but just remember to pipe them very thin or you&apos;ll end up with raw insides and burned outside!
5,"These churros were so delicious, they taste better then what we used to get as kids when we spent the day at Olvera Street in LA... and I always thought those were the best.  These were perfect!  Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I&apos;m going to use this recipe all the time, thanks for the great recipe I was so very pleasantly suprised, it&apos;s a very simple recipe but it&apos;s results are so great and authentic."
5,Very easy recipe and outcome was excellent! Very authentic! Tip: Fry dough ASAP to avoid gooey mess.
5,"What a fun and delicious treat for my kids.  A little tricky to make, as you really do have to let the batter cool a little before putting in the piping bag.  I had to double bag mine in order for the batter to not melt through.  I agree with others that it&apos;s better to pipe all of them on parchment paper, and then just add them to the oil a few at a time.  Piping them directly into the oil did not work for me.  I immediately rolled them in the cinnamon sugar mixture to make sure it stuck and they were well coated.  My kids were so thrilled.  The only problem is that now they expect me to make these on a regular basis."
4,This was a really good recipe. My kids loved them. You can&apos;t handle too much and needs to be used asap or it will break apart while frying.
3,These were pretty good except they were much tougher than churros I&apos;ve bought. I didn&apos;t overmix but they ended up chewy. I also had to make sure I didn&apos;t make them too thick because my first batch wasn&apos;t cooked all the way through. My kids liked them though.
5,"This recipe is the perfect base for any hot artichoke dip. Make it just the way it is 1-1-1 or mix it up with some chopped jalepenos, spinach, green peppers or roasted garlic. Depending on the crowd I serve it to, I adjust it accordingly. The only downfall, there&apos;s never enough. When making for a crowd make a quadruple batch at least. It even works in the crock pot."
3,"Very tasty. Would add a 1/2-tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and maybe some Worsteshire sauce. Make sure to rinse the artichoke hearts, otherwise fishy taste occurs. Also, bake a few more minutes for extra golden top."
5,I&apos;ve been making this dip for years also. It&apos;s one of my favorites. I add a sprinkle of garlic salt and definitely use Hellman&apos;s. Once time for a change I decided to spread the dip on a Boboli&apos; crust and bake it. I cut it up into small slices. Yummy!
5,My mom used to make this and I forgot how good it was until I came across the recipe here and made it over the holidays. No one I&apos;ve served it to believes it&apos;s only 3 ingredients. I find that it&apos;s easiest to chop the artichokes in the food processor. I also like to mix all the ingredients and let it chill over night so the flavors can blend. It also comes out best if you use freshly grated or &apos;premium&apos; (found in your grocer&apos;s deli case or cheese case) parmesan rather than the stuff in a can. I also recommend using Hellmann&apos;s mayo for the best results. Thanks for reminding me what a simple but great recipe this is.
5,"Fabulous dip and totally idiot proof! SO simple and so good....this is one of my ""go to"" recipes when we have company. It turns out best when you use Hellman&apos;s mayo....don&apos;t use the light mayo it doesn&apos;t work as well! I also throw in a couple of minced garlic cloves."
5,I frequently make this artichoke dip recipe with the addition of fresh chopped garlic. Fantastic baked as a dip but also quite delicious when spooned into mini phyllo cups and baked until bubbly rave reviews.
4,GREAT AND EASY RECIPE!! JUST DONT FORGET TO ADD LEMON JUICE....IVE BEEN MAKING THIS FOR YEARS NOW BUT ALWAYS ADD THE LEMON JUICE IT KICKS IT UP A NOTCH. BIG HIT AT ALL MY PARTIES!!!!! have fun!
5,Great with a small can of green chiles added.
5,Thank you. I finally found my favorite dip from years past. This is the best dip goes well with a toasted bagel or vegies or any dip friendly foods. Yes it&apos;s true you can&apos;t use generic mayo. I think Helmans or Kraft brand mayo works best.
5,"Hey ya&apos;ll! Thanks for all the great reviews--I am so flattered! Thanks, also, for not making the recipe completely different than written and then stating how you don&apos;t like it. I don&apos;t understand that. Thanks again. Don&apos;t forget to use EXTRA-SHARP cheddar cheese! **UPDATE 6/24/2011** Thanks to Yakaty for suggesting the addition of worchestershire and mustard. It makes this even better IMO! Thanks again to all for the reviews! PS If it ain&apos;t Duke&apos;s, it ain&apos;t mayo! ;)"
5,"This was without a doubt the best pimento cheese I&apos;ve ever had!  I omitted the jalapenos, and bumped up the cayenne a bit since I like my pimento cheese with a bit of a bite to it.  Other than that, this recipe is flawless.  Thank you so much for sharing!"
5,This is exactly the way I&apos;ve always made Pimento Cheese (minus the jalepeno).  I took some to work once and 4 people told me it was the best they&apos;ve ever had.  Yum!
5,"If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This is phenomenal! After eating the store bought all my life, I knew there had to be something better than that . I found a guy at a farmer&apos;s market who sells it homemade but he was charging $8 for a tiny container. After much griping from the hubby about spending that much on pimento cheese every week, I finally decided to try it myself & I am so glad I did. This blows farmer&apos;s market guy out of the water. The 1 tiny change I made was that I just used a hand mixer to mix the cream cheese, Mayo & spices. I folded in the grated cheese, jalapeno, & pimentos so it would maintain a chunky texture."
4,"First time trying this and I liked the concept.  True to form, I increased the cayenne just a little for a longer finish, added a tad of dry mustard, and some worcestershire sauce in the spirit of Beer Cheese soup.  This recipe didn&apos;t need it from my tasting but it fit my taste.  Time to give it to the troops to try."
5,"This is a favorite at our house. I always make my own pimento as well, since the jarred stuff is so expensive. Just broil or roast a red pepper until the skin is black, stick in a plastic bag to cool, then peel off the skin and clean out the seeds. Fresh pimento!"
2,"All pimento cheese recipes apparently aren&apos;t equal.  I definitely didn&apos;t like the cream cheese in it at all.  The garlic was out of place as well.  I&apos;ll keep trying other recipes, this is not what I was hoping for."
5,"This is really good. A gourmet grocery store by my house used to sell pimento cheese in a jar that was expensive. They used to sample it and it was so good. I had been looking for a recipe to duplicate it and this is very close. I left out the optional ingredients and I didn&apos;t have pimentos but I had some small diced red peppers and used that. I made 1/2 recipe and it made about a cup and a half. The only thing that seemed to be missing was the sharper taste of the spread the store sampled and then I realized that the recipe suggested ""extra-sharp cheddar"" so I would use that specifically. The cheese should also not be pre-shredded, both are important for the flavor and texture. This will be great with crackers or to make grilled cheese out of this week. Thank you!"
5,"Jalapeno is optional although it is good to make a double batch of this and add Jalapeno to the second batch. Make a grilled cheese from the Jalapeno batch using raisin bread, top burgers with it or add it to grits! There are countless ways to use Pimento cheese. And for heavens sake don&apos;t use Miracle Whip! The BEST mayo for pimento cheese is Duke&apos;s!! Hope you enjoy is as much as we do."
5,"This is very close to the recipe my mom used as I was growing up.  She would make 50-100 at a time and freeze whatever wasn&apos;t used.  You don&apos;t need to defrost them when you&apos;re ready to cook.  Remember when frying the lumpia, put the seam down first - it helps to seal it better.  The dipping sauce we used was a mix of vinegar, pepper, crushed garlic and tiny chilies (and/or some soy sauce.)"
5,"My boyfriend is Filipino and I&apos;ve eaten lumpia at every party and get-together we&apos;ve had with his family.  This recipe is the closest thing to the lumpia his mother makes.  The only changes I tried were to half the green onions and add in 1/4 cup chopped fresh green beans, omit the salt and use low sodium soy sauce and add 2 tsps Adobo seasoning to the meat.  This adds a little more flavor without too much extra salt.  I also doubled the recipe and made beef, beef and pork, and just pork lumpia.  We like the mixture of beef and pork best!  We also dip our lumpia in a sweet chili sauce, which can be found in any asian market.  This is a GREAT recipe!  Thanks Christina."
5,Very very good! Very easy to do too. I ended up with about 15-16 rolls though. I chopped the veggies in the food processor. I used a pastry brush to brush some water on the ends of the wrappers to seal them. I fried them 3-4 at a time in my deep frier. One of my favorite recipes from this site so far. I&apos;ve made these with shrimp/pork mixture and they are even better.
5,"This is a great base recipe.  Lumpia recipes are flexible and you can add or subtract whatever you want.  Traditionally the raw meat is mixed with the spices, rolled, and cooked.  One advantage to precooking the meat is you can add more spices/ingredients to taste after the meat is cooked.  Before I remove the final mixture from the stove I will add dashes of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil until it tastes the way I want it.  Another good tip is to let the final mixture sit over night. This makes a big difference in the following: 1. the juices/spices coagulate and soak into the meat giving a much nicer flaver 2. Rolling is much easier because the filling is no longer wet and soaking into the wrappers 3. Since the wrappers don&apos;t absorb all of the moisture, they brown very slowly and you get a super crisp lumpia without over browning the outside and blackening the ends.  Thanks again for the recipe!!"
5,"This is a great recipe! However, I reccommend adding 1 head of cabbage and 4 medium sized carrots. The extra veggies just seem to add to the flavor and turn out just like I remember them from when I was a child. I also reccommend trying a apple cider vinegar and garlic dipping sauce--4 cloves garlic to 1 cup apple vinegar. Thanks for the great recipe!! :)"
5,As as child in my hometown there was a large Filipino community. Therefore I grew up on Lumpia. ( They are so superior to Chinese eggrolls. ) Also Lumpia wrappers are readily available in most Asian markets. Perhaps for this good review in return the submitter Christina could add on this web site a recipe for pancit?:)
5,Positively delicious! (hey guys!) This makes a terrific appetizer but my gang prefered this as part of their meal. I&apos;m fortuante to have a terrific Asian market in the area so the wrappers were easy to find. (by the way there is a pancit recipe on this site) Also wonderful! Thanks so much Christina!
5,"For those who can&apos;t find lumpia wrappers, you can make your own. it&apos;s just equal parts of rice flour and water. use a nylon pastry brush to &apos;paint&apos; the batter on a large skillet and take the pan out of the fire once it&apos;s dry. just flip the cooked wrapper on top of some parchment paper and put on your filling. Whenever I cook lumpia, I prefer to use fresh wrappers because I can adjust how thick or thin I want the wrappers."
5,I&apos;ve tried the other Lumpia recipes on this site and they do not even compare to this one. These turned out delicious! Everyone in my family absolutely loved them. I even froze half of them and cooked them a couple of weeks later and they tasted just as good as the first batch. Thanks for this great recipe!
3,Not to keen on the flavor...I&apos;m still going to search for what I was introduced as a Lumpia. I&apos;m sure there are lots of recipes out there...I just need to find it. Also I could only get egg roll wrappers....I really wanted spring roll wrappers. It really makes a difference in taste.
5,"I love this recipe, however, I have to admit, I changed it somewhat.  My daughter had made this and said that she had replaced some of the oil with applesauce.  One of the other comments said that it was awfully sweet, and I am trying to cut down on fat and sugar, so......I cut the sugar in half (only 1 cup), omitted the oil and put in 1 cup of applesauce.  It turned out scrumptious!"
1,"Don&apos;t know what I did wrong, but this bread would not cook through, even though I followed directions and then cooked for 15 extra minutes! I cut it open anyway to see how it tasted, and it was way to sweet. I will not be making this again."
5,"Really good!  Super dense and moist so if you love that type of baked good you will love this.  Next time I will add nuts because for me I think it would make it even better.  Thanks for sharing!!
                                UPDATE - I tried the bread with the nuts and suprisingly I did not like it as much.  Made it a third time adding some raisins and absolutely loved the addition.  Also increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp."
5,Very good -- dense and sweet. I consider it a dessert bread. The changes I made to the recipe was to use 2.5 cups of cubed McIntosh apples to which I added the juice of one lemon. I also added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the dry ingredients. I also used a full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
5,"I&apos;ve made this several times for two years now, and each time it gets rave reviews! To add some depth I usually replace 1/2c of the white sugar for 1/2c dark brown sugar, and applesauce in lieu of some vegetable oil. Go generous on the vanilla and extra generous on the cinnamon! It needs an extra 20 minutes to bake, too."
5,"I made this recipe with a few changes. I do not like baking loaves, they never cook in the middle. I put the batter in muffin cups and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. They came out moist and delicious! As others have suggested, I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar. I also doubled the cinnamon. I also added chopped walnuts."
5,"This recipe was a amazing! The bread came out perfect, with a crispy crust and moist inside. I used red delicious apples, and I doubled the cinnamon, but that was all I changed. Overall great!"
5,"I was having lunch with a friend I hadn&apos;t seen for a while and wanted to take her something so I whipped this up real quick and took it warm.  She said it was the best thing she&apos;d ever put in her mouth!  I changed it slightly by using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I also used Granny Smith apples mainly because so many reviews said it was too sweet.  I sprinkled the top with turbinado sugar before baking.  After the suggested baking time, it was still soft in the middle so I turned off the oven and left it for about another 15 minutes.  It was fine after that.  I will be making this again, this time for me!"
5,"MAde as directed......purrrrrrrrrfect!! People who change recipes around and then rate them, need to be strangled till they turn beet red."
5,6.4.19 Mixed up the marinade in the morning added the chicken cubes and marinated all day for an easy evening dinner. I live in Florida so we pretty much can grill out all year. But when it gets as hot as it is now it s no fun standing out by a grill so I really liked that this was done in the oven (used my toaster oven) in 20 minutes. Honestly grilling may have been better and that may be an option when it cools down but for now the oven worked great. This chicken was absolutely delicious tender moist good selection of herbs bright flavor from the lemon juice simply wouldn t change a thing! Thanks for sharing your recipe we thoroughly enjoyed it
4,Very easy recipe to follow. The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars was that I tend to eyeball my ingredients. The lemon was a little strong but it was still very good! Cooked with rice and steamed veggies. Will make again!
4,"We (my husband & I )liked it. He gave it 4 stars.
                                I’m sure I’ll use it again."
5,There wasn’t any chicken at the grocery store so I made this with pork. It was very delicious and I will make again.
4,"If you like lemon chicken . . this is your recipe!! This recipe was very easy to assemble as it followed the directions to a tee. 
                                We were very impressed with the tenderness of the chicken. In fact, the leftovers were almost as good as the originally baked skewers. 
                                Next attempt will attempt to slightly lesson the lemon flavour. I wonder if BBQ vs. oven will offset some of the lemon flavour.
                                  Regardless this recipe is a keeper."
5,This is an excellent recipe! We baked ours but I suspect they would be even better on the grill in terms of texture.
4,"Spices need to be doubled, but don&apos;t double the oil."
5,very tasty dish
4,350 at 20 minutes didn’t cut it for me. They were barely done. Either my oven is busted or that needs to be re-examined.
4,"For as simple as this recipe was, it was pretty tasty. Don&apos;t fear the mayo - you cannot taste it! The only change I made was to slightly pulse the onion soup mix in my food processor to get a more even texture.  No additional salt/pepper was needed upon serving.  The one issue I had was the mayo in the microwave. I heated it for 20 seconds and it curlded - not very appetizing, but I was able to brush it on the chicken regardless.  I would leave the step out next time. Just whisk the mayo and garlic paste together, and it&apos;ll be a good consistency to brush on the chicken, no heating needed.  Depending on the size of your chicken breasts, you may need to bake them a little longer, but I found 20 minutes to be perfect for the 6-8oz breasts I was using."
5,"My husband absolutely loved this moist, tender chicken...so much he ate 2. I omitted the mayo (NOT A FAN) I substituted with 2 eggs mixed with 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. I will absolutely make this again."
5,"Very good recipe.  I did not have garlic paste but wanted to substitute something else to boost flavor a bit more, so I mixed a little Dijon mustard with the mayo.  Delicious!"
5,"I haven’t made it yet, but I look forward to doing so because for many years I’ve used mayonnaise as a base layer for breading with mixtures of breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, minced dried onions, nuts, etc. Mayo works great with chicken, but also fish and veal.  Everything oven “fries”! and comes out super moist and flavorful."
2,"If I were to make this again, I would cut the onion soup mix by half, and pulverize it in a blender or food processor, as another person suggested, before proceeding. My family commented that while the chicken was moist and flavorful, the onion soup mix was way too obvious. (I didn&apos;t tell them what the ingredients were.) Hubby complained he was, ""choking on onion soup dust."" Ooops."
5,It was so good and easy meal!
5,The whole family loved it. Thanks!
5,This was easy to prepare and came out very moist.
5,"Wouldn&apos;t change an ingredient. Perfectly done, subtle change in flavors. Looking forward to this recipe soon."
4,"The chicken was delicious, but on top of rice it was a bit dry. We added some soy sauce, and that was good."
5,Made this recipe and it was moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. We ate as a main course with mashed potatoes. We thought it was simply yummy.
4,"It was ok, but we expected more depth in the flavors given the type of ingredients. There was nothing from the rosemary or ginger.
                                We will make it again but boost the amount of spice."
4,I really liked it. But I made a big change to it. I replaced the rosemary with red pepper flakes. Turned out great!!! The only thing I would do differently is double the Apricot topping so that there is some left over to spoon over the top right before you serve it.
2,"Full marks for flavor, especially as I used fresh ginger and added garlic. I don&apos;t think I pounded it enough because the thicker parts of the chicken took too long to get up to temperature, and the thinner sections were dried out and a bit tough.  The real killer was cleaning the burned off glaze from the instant pot air fryer I cooked it in.  
                                I will use definitely the modified glaze again, but look for a different way to cook it."
5,This was very good and I will definitely make it again. The sauce is wonderful!
5,Excellent.  Subbed squeeze garlic and ground ginger for the garlic ginger paste and Sriracha for the garlic chili sauce.  Have passed this recipe around and will make it many times.  Served it with brown rice.  Thank you for a great recipe!
5,"Just a delightful dish. I’d seen sheet pan meals videos and finally made this. I couldn’t find ginger-garlic paste during the pandemic, so I used minced garlic, a little Sriracha sauce and powdered ginger.  Probably not a perfect mix, but it was very forgiving. My teens liked it too!  I’ll put this on the rotation."
5,"Looks just like the photo, taste great. Didn’t have the rice wine so I used Apple cider vinegar. Followed the recipe, made my own garlic - ginger paste with 1T grape oil, 2T garlic powder and 1 T of ground ginger. Didn’t have Avocado oil so I used Grape seed oil . Omitted chili paste , didn’t have it , meal turned out great and had a little sauce left over which will Kyiv the fridge."
3,"I was torn between 2 and 3 stars on this one, but decided on 3 because some tweaks can be made to improve it. First off, this was way too salty and I&apos;m a big salt fan.  As I was mixing together the spice blend, I was thinking it was making an awful lot and that there was a ton of salt since lemon pepper seasoning is already salty as is...but I went with it.  On the two chicken breasts, I only used 1/4 of the seasoning I had mixed up because there was so much of it, and it still came out too salty.  The amount of seasoning as written would be enough for about 8 breasts.  I highly recommend you only make a half batch at most, and leave out the salt - only sprinkle some on at the end if needed.  I used 8oz breasts and they were done at 10 minutes. The onions were starting to burn, so keep an eye on things. I do like broiling chicken though, as they tend to come out juicy (assuming you don&apos;t overcook them!)."
5,It&apos;s indeed easy to make and I&apos;m sure it&apos;s delicious too.
4,yes i added 2 more breast of chicken for four and doubled up on ingrediants
5,"At first, I wasn&apos;t sure of the lemon pepper with paprika, but this turned out to be a great recipe with just a couple of revisions. I ended up squeezing a 1/2 lemon and marinated for a couple of hours. After marinating, I seared the chicken, then placed on the onion and marinade and baked at 350 degrees until complete. Very tasty indeed!"
5,"The recipe was perfect and my family loved the flavor on the chicken, thanks for the great recipe!!"
3,"It&apos;s easy and quick to make, but nothing to write home about."
5,My family went for seconds. It&apos;s easy to make and tastes great. I will be making this often.
5,"This was so flavorful!  I didn’t use garlic, oil or onion, but I also made it on the grill."
3,"It was ok.  It needed something more.
                                Made exactly like the recipe. but I would not make again."
4,"These are really good but also spicy. I love the spice but my family couldn&apos;t eat it. So if you don&apos;t want that much heat, maybe use one can of chili in Adobe sauce or just use Adobe sauce. They are easy to make and delicious but next time I will have to change it slightly."
3,"This was OK. I didn&apos;t have the cojita cheese, so just used extra shredded Mexican cheese. Otherwise, followed the recipe as is.  Flavor was good - kind of has an enchilada flavor, but dry. I was concerned about the tortilla chips getting mushy when covered in the sauce - so I did tossed them quickly. However, they kind of mushed together when baked - so I wasn&apos;t very fond of the texture. If it had more sauce, maybe it would be better.  If I made this again, I would use fewer chips, increase the sauce and eat with a lot of salsa and sour cream. Also - if you already have shredded chicken on hand, that will save a lot of time!"
5,Super easy and LOTS of flavor!
4,It sounds really good except I couldn&apos;t make it due to 2 of the ingredients not listed completely.
5,"Okay, I probably overdid it with the tortilla chips, and I would make the tomato sauce mixture even bigger ---- but this was a REAL HIT for my family of 7.  I got lots of ""thanks for making that , Mom"" from all the kids.  I used the InstaPot to pressure cook the chicken.  I think that helped make it moist.  I doubled the recipe.  Will make again for sure."
5,"This was very tasty!  I’ll make this again and again.  Times maybe aren’t accurate, but I did enjoy this."
5,"Delicious, with a unique taste. I&apos;ll definitely make this recipe again."
1,"I used a dark beer which might have made the difference, but I don&apos;t think I liked it enough to try it with a lighter beer."
5,"Solid, easy recipe!"
5,yes
5,"Great taste
                                Took longer to cook, but worth the extra wait"
5,"This is so easy and taste better than the Chicken Parmesan at Olive Garden!!  I didn&apos;t make it ahead, just did it all at once.   We did fettuccine noodles with it and it is a definite make again soon from family!"
5,"OK - if you are like me, you will look at the ingredients and instructions for this receipe and say to yourself ""Jeez people, what is the big deal?"" Well- don&apos;t do it. I chose this receipe simply because I had a whole chicken, not a lot of time, and needed to cook it.  I have NO idea why the combination of these ingredients or this cooking method (I followed it EXACTLY as written, but used real butter) yields such a wonderfully TASTY bird...but it does!  If you don&apos;t try this, you&apos;re missing out. If you do try this, I venture to say that, you will be very pleasantly surprised!"
5,"O.k. Back again - I entered a chicken cook off and used your recipe.  Didnt change anything on the recipe.  i won first prize out of about 50 entries.  I got a nice plaque and trophy, a little prize money.  Best part was the honor of it all.  just wanted you to know your recipe is BLUE RIBBON>>>>>!!!! congrats"
5,one bad review listed for my grandma&apos;s recipe says the recipe calls for too much butter.  the recipe has no butter in it.  I have tried this recipe with promise lite spread and it came out juicy as ever.  Recipe calls for margarine and I am happy to say low fat or lite works just as good.
5,"I used the advice that the reviewer on the recipe page said:  Use in combination with Moist Garlic Chicken.  I sliced 8 garlic cloves and put in cavity, under skin and on top YUM!  I also sliced 2 small lemons and put one in cavity and the other on top.  Put 1/4 cup butter in cavity and 1/4 cup sliced butter on top. Put cut celery in cavity, and then salt/peppered all over. Roasted for 2 hours - turned out perfect.  The GRAVY was AWESOME!!  Some flour with the oils, then chicken broth and all the browned bits from the pan and juices from carving.  This was my first roast chicken.  Will make over and over!!"
5,"I beg you to try this one as written! Don&apos;t be one of those fools who write, what a delicious recipe! Then they proceed to tell you about the 1oo herbs and spices they added to this recipe. LIke I always say - if ya change the recipe that is nice - probably delicious - but it aint&apos;t the same recipe no more. This one is delicious - keep your hands off!"
5,"I used a combination of 2 recipies from this site. This one and ""Moist Garlic Roasted Chicken"". It turned out perfectly. For my seasoning I used garlic powder (instead of onion) and lots of salt and pepper both on the outside, and in the cavity. Next time I will probably add some rosemary. The other recipe called for stuffing the cavity with lemon slices and garlic gloves. The flavours were great, and it turned out really juicy. Thank you for this recipe :)"
5,"why is it that people give less than five stars on a wonderful recipe when they don&apos;t even cook it as it was written? at least try it the way it was written before you make changes, and if your changes don&apos;t work out how is that the fault of the original recipe? this is a wonderful recipe the way it was written, maybe you should try it that way."
5,"My family and i absolutely love this recipe!We have made it 7 times and it has never failed us! We added a some garlic powder the second time and it made the worlds diff. My family and i arent big on white meat but when we make this recipe no one knows witch is witch ! I most definetely would recommend this recipe to anyone !We also added rosemarry,onions,onion powder,mushrooms,and celery and came out even better !"
3,I believe the bake time for this recipe is incorrect.  I baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes and it was not done.  Wonder if it should have been two hours and fifteen minutes?
5,"The first time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it tasted great but was too dry. So I doubled the sauce, used a deep dish pie plate, reduced the temp to 375 & baked for 45 minutes. It was perfectly moist without being runny, and the pie shells were perfectly done. Absolutely fabulous! Goes without saying it is a keeper!"
5,"After reviewing several ratings I made some recommended changes. The first being I added more seasoning (garlic pepper, garlic powder, poultry seasoning) to the sauce and to the chicken mixture before cooking. Also, I cooked the chicken and veggies in chicken stock instead of water. My husband doesn&apos;t like celery so I used potato instead and also added some corn. I used Pillsbury ready made pie crusts (so easy..just open and unroll). And after brushing with egg white, baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes. I doubled the sauce and added most to the chicken mixture before putting it into the pan.  I baked on 375 for 40 minutes. It looked and tasted delicious!!"
5,"I&apos;m giving this recipe 5 stars for the way it turned out after my modifications, without them I doubt it would have been as good.  I took a lot of the previous suggestions, and I boiled my veggies in chicken broth (just added a boullion cube) although I didn&apos;t use peas (can&apos;t stand them) and just boneless, skinless breast meat. I used 3/4 cup of onion, and subbed 1/2 tsp garlic powder for celery seed (didn&apos;t have any).  I drained the broth from the veggies, and used 2 cups in the pan, and after I added everything into the crust, I poured about another 1/4 cup of broth in with everything (as other reviewers complained it was too dry).  Cooked for 30 min in a gas oven, and it came out perfect! Will definitely make again.
                                
                                edited to add: I also made this with 3 small, cubed potatoes, and it made it even better."
3,"Boil the chicken and veggies? For 15 minutes?  And then throw the broth away?  Then add canned broth?  Really?  Is that how to do it?  I suggest sauteeing the chicken pieces, celery and onion together, adding the frozen veggies, add the broth, spices and mix the flour with a little water to add and thicken the mixture."
5,"This was SO delicious, the best I have ever tasted.  I made it with the ""Butter Flaky Pie Crust"" and it turned out perfectly flaky and wonderful.  I pre-baked the bottom crust for 6 minutes, doubled the black pepper, added a tsp. of poultry seasoning and garlic salt and a diced potato.  I added an extra 1/4 c each of milk and broth to combat any dryness.  It turned out SPECTACULAR and was a huge hit with the family...they even ate it for breakfast.  Will definitely make this again."
4,"I am not a ""pot pie"" fan but made this for my guy yesterday. Took the advice of others and used a rotisserie chicken, added poultry seasoning and garlic powder, etc. Also used frozen deep dish pie shells. Next time I will mix the filling and gravy together before putting it in the shell. I couldn&apos;t get the liquid to seep down through which caused the filling to be a bit too dry. I also think it needed a little bit more salt so will use garlic salt rather than powder next time. It was still pretty good considering my distaste for ""pot pies"". Definitely think mixing the filling with the liquid is the answer.  Update:  made this again but used frozen mixed veggies in addition to a cubed potato and the onion. Made extra gravy (about 1/2 more) and mixed with the filling before putting in the pie shell. Really helped the dryness.   Yet another update: Made this again using phyllo puff pastry in ramekins and wow is it good! Perfect size for the grand kids who loved it!  We also froze some and took to work for lunch - takes about 5-7 minutes in the microwave! Note:  I always have L.B. Jamison&apos;s chicken soup base on hand and add a spoonful to chicken & noodles, chicken soup, this recipe and others.  Really brings out the flavor!"
5,"This was AMAZING! My family kept raving how good it was. Like others before me, I boiled the veggies and the chicken in the chicken broth. When the chicken was done I saute&apos;d it in butter with garlic, onions, salt and pepper. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup because I needed more gravy. There was so much meat and veggies that I put it in a 9x13 pan and topped it with two pilsbury already made dough. I brushed the top of the dough with egg white and it came out so wonderful! What a recipe. I will be making this again and again.
                                
                                Update - I made this with left over roast from last nights meal and it was amazing. I used beef broth and also a jar of beef gravy so we&apos;d have extra. My kids liked it better then the chicken pot pie."
5,"I&apos;ve been making this for years now, and I&apos;ve adjusted the recipe as follows: 1) I double the sauce recipe as others suggest, 2) I add in poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and chili powder to the sauce to taste, 3) I just use a 16oz package of frozen mixed veggies and a diced potato. I boil these in broth with the chicken, 4) After the sauce has thickened, I dump the chicken and veggies (after draining) into the saucepan and stir it all together before putting it in my pie.
                                
                                Doubling the sauce and adding extra veggies gives me a little leftover filling when I do a regular deep dish pie (I&apos;m ok with this though, as I happily eat the filling on its own). However, usually I make 2 dozen mini pies in my muffin tin, cooking for 20 minutes. I love these mini pies because I&apos;m constantly on the run and can eat them with one hand without a fork and knife!"
5,This recipe was wonderful! It definately puts the frozen pot pies to shame.  I only did one thing differently after reading others reviews saying that the bottom crust was soggy.  I beat an egg white and brushed it on the bottom crust before putting in the filling.  It worked great! I also brushed it on the top crust as well.  It was SO delicious!
3,"I use a little more flavorful breading, 1cup of panko, 1cup of seasoned bread crumbs, and a cup of parmesan cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped fresh parsley, a teaspoon of fresh chopped Thyme and a teaspoon of garlic powder. I brown the chicken in half butter and half olive oil. I also cook some angel hair while the chicken is browning, and put it under the chicken in a casserole dish, cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes, remove foil, add cheese and bake another 10 minutes"
3,"3 stars because this was good with my common sense modifications. I do not know how any one of you got a good result as written. #1 - 4 c. of breadcrumbs?! Whoa! Not right. I used 1 c. plus 1/2c. shredded Italian cheese blend. #2. Recipe calls for 1/2c of sauce yet in directions you are to use 1/3c. x 4 chicken breasts...? You need to &apos;eye this up&apos; and put enough sauce on each piece. #3 - You cannot use 1 c. of olive oil! Did you all do this? And you had a good result? The chicken would be swimming in oil! I used a little olive oil (maybe 2 TBS?) along with a TBS of butter. #4 - Flour is not needed. #5 - Mozz cheese should be shredded, not &apos;fresh&apos; for best melting result. #6- Don&apos;t put fresh basil on so early. It will burn - leave it for the last 5 min or use dried. Now, with these changes, the dish was delicious - but I guess it is now my own version of chicken parmesan."
5,Great recipe!  Juicy and flavorful exactly as written.
5,"This recipe was really easy to follow & turned out great!  My 1st try at chicken parmesan, total success :-)"
5,"Have to admit if it&apos;s not easy and/or tasty I won&apos;t put the effort in. The WHOLE famiily loved this, and every recipe gets easier each time its&apos; made, right?
                                I only used 1/2 the Panko. I didn&apos;t use the crumbs sparingly either. I only put 2 c in, and had the other 2 c in a bowl in case they were needed. I cut the chicken breasts in half before using the meat mallet. The fillet seemed too big without doing this, and it was easier for someone to have a second helping. I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce. I Loved the sifter for the flour; that worked great!
                                Given that I had twice as many fillets, next time, I would probably use half the oil, so I could have clean oil and maybe do the chicken in 2 batches. (I also used paper towels for excell oil.)
                                As much as I loved this recipe, given the calories/fat, I would not make it as often as I&apos;d like.
                                10/2012- Just made this again for Sunday dinner, the family LOVES this recipe! I skipped/forgot the provolone this time around and used shredded mozzerella. Even though it&apos;s not as crispy, I made sure to have enough for leftovers. Also- use paper towels to collect extra oil after frying. TIP- If you buy chicken in bulk, then cut, trim, and pound with mallet before freezing for later use, this saves lots of time during actual recipe."
4,"Some time ago, I learned a useful trick: instead of steps 3-6 above, after the chicken breasts have been pounded and seasoned as in step 2, lightly brush both sides with heavy 33-35%MF whipping cream (use a pastry brush). Then transfer breasts to breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture as made in step 4, pressing the crumbs into both sides.
                                
                                I now use this method for virtually all recipes which call for breading, including fish, pork, veal, etc.  It is easier and less messy than using flour, eggs and milk to bind the breading to the meat and I have found that it works equally well."
5,"All I can say is Wow! I have made chicken parmesan using the most popular recipe from this site, but this recipe blew the other out of the park! This is a no brainer. My goal in writing this review is to let Members know that just because a recipe has a thousand hits/reviews, does not always mean its the best. I followed this recipe for the most part, however, made a few changes. I substituted regular bread crumbs and a jar of Classico traditional sweet basil. This turned out amazing! I used the entire jar of sauce because I served it over penne pasta. I put a thin spread of sauce on the bottom of the pan prior to placing the chicken inside. This recipe will definitely be a keeper and I won&apos;t hesitate to forward this recipe on to others. What a treat!"
5,"Incredible dish! Great for dinner guests.  For those folks cooking in high altitude, 15 or 20 minutes is not quite enough to cook the chicken breasts.  You might want to cook them a little longer (6-7 minutes) on top of the stove or microwave them for several minutes (3 minutes)before serving.  Cut them in half to check doneness before serving. If you put them back in the oven for too long, the cheese might burn."
5,"I made this exactly as directed and it was GREAT! So easy and fast - fabulous use of bnls/sknls chicken breast. It came out moist & tender with the crunchy top - perfect. Served it on angel hair pasta with buttered italian bread and it was a hit. Thank you John - your wife is lucky to have you! I love your videos & sense of humor, and your food is excellent! (swoon...get me the fainting couch!)"
4,"Great dip for football season! I used Texas Pete Buffalo Style Chicken Wing Sauce, 1/3 less-fat cream cheese (aka Neufchatel), and 1 lb. of fresh chicken that was boiled for 20 minutes (or until done) and then shredded. However, to avoid the strange ""orange sherbert"" color of the dip, I layered the ingredients in a 8""x11"" baking dish as follows:  Mix together the softened cream cheese and ranch dressing and spread evenly in the bottom of the dish.  Then mix together the shredded chicken and wing sauce (about 2/3 bottle)and layer on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Sprinkle just a small amount of shredded cheese (I used Colby/Jack) over the top.  Bake at 350 for about 20-25 minutes or until dip is heated through and cheese is melted.  I just think people tend to shy away from the dip when it&apos;s all mixed together because of the strange color.  It&apos;s more recognizable (retains a brighter red color) when it&apos;s layered and gets gobbled up faster!"
5,"I have made a variation of this recipe for over a year now and have never been disappointed.  I suggest using more chicken and more hot sauce with this recipe. Also, if you use the chedder cheese, don&apos;t use the pre-shredded bags from the grocery store.  The cheese in those bags is coated with flour and it seems to make the dip oiler."
5,"the biggest hit for the superbowl party!  I did use bleu cheese dressing instead of ranch because thats what you eat with buffalo chicken!  I also used 2 boneless chicken breasts instead of canned chicken (i cant stand canned meats) grilled it in a pan, cut it into bite sized pieces, put it back in the pan with the hot sauce. When I mixed the the cream cheese and bleu cheese together I added more hotsauce for more of a kick.  Baked in an 8x8 pan, 350 for 20 minutes.  Dip was gone in minutes!   will make 100 more times!!"
5,"A KEEPER! A really tasty and unique dip with the perfect amount of zip. I used 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts, boiled and shredded. (I can&apos;t stand canned meat) I mixed all ingredients and baked it in a uncovered casserole dish for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Then I converted it to a crock pot to keep it warm. I served it with tostito scoops and celery. It was the talk of the party!!"
5,"I got this recipe about a month ago off of this site to take to a pitch-in and since then have made it 3 more times!  It&apos;s a total hit and everyone loves it!  My changes (okay, I made quite a few): use 1/2 cup Frank&apos;s Buffalo Wing Sauce and 1/2 cup Red Hot, 1/2 cup of Ranch dressing and 1/2 cup Blue Cheese dressing, and put almost all of the cheese in the dip and just sprinkle some on top.  Oh yeah, and we used fresh chicken shredded in the food processor as someone suggested.  And we didn&apos;t like the crock pot method - it made the dip get dried out pretty quickly.  We just cooked it on the stove and put it into a serving dish (we did end up puting in the microwave a few times, but that was okay).  This is great because the recipe itself is very low carbs and you can use low fat cream cheese, dressing, and cheese and you don&apos;t experience all that much guilt... especially when served with celery sticks (although those Fritos scoops are fabulous!)  Thanks for this one!"
5,"This is a great and easy appetizer to make and is very well received and I have never brought any home from any party.  I read the reviews before making it and like many others I made a few modifications that I think helped make the recipe better.  I used 1 lb of skinless chicken breasts which I cleaned, sliced into strips and par boiled for 15 minutes, drained, and cooled for a few minutes.  When the chicken is cool it will be very easy to shred with your fingers.  I used a large skillet where I placed 1 Cup of Frank’s Red hot which is what is used in Buffalo, NY at the Anchor Bar to make real Buffalo chicken wings.  I also added a ½ stick of butter which is also a very common ingredient in the preparation of Buffalo chicken wings.  While the chicken and Frank’s is warming slowly, I mixed one cup of Blue cheese dressing and the cream cheese until smooth and placed it into the refrigerator until I was ready to make the dip. After the chicken and Frank’s were good and warm I placed this into a plastic container for later use as well.  This gets everything ready for the next day or for later in the day to just place it together and warm in the oven.  When I was ready for the dip I pre-heated the oven to 350 placed the blue cheese mixture into the bottom of a 7x11” baking pan and layered the chicken onto the top of the blue cheese.  I topped the whole thing with a small amount of shredded mozzarella / provolone cheese and po"
5,"This is sooo good!!!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in the oven for 20 min instead of the slow-cooker. Next time I&apos;ll try it with blue cheese dressing instead od ranch. Either way, you can&apos;t go wrong!"
5,I made this today for the first time and it is excellent!! I have been trying out lots of different recipes to prepare for my annual Halloween party and this one will definately make it to the table! Canned chicken is repulsive to me so I used rotissary chicken (from Sams) which has such wonderful flavor and compliments the entire dish. Also...nothing beats Franks Original Hot Sauce! Used blue cheese instead of ranch and 1/3 less fat cream cheese. Combined all in the crock pot and let it sit on low for a couple of hours. Served with tortilla chips celery and scoops. Yum yum yum!!!
5,"This is excellent. I&apos;ve made this dish many times and everyone keeps requesting it again. I mix 1/2 Ranch dressing and 1/2 blue cheese. I do not use the chedder cheese. I tried it once and did not care for the oily orange greasy appearance. A few other ""improvements"" I&apos;ve made are I melt 1/2 a stick of butter before warming the meat in the frying pan. Also I recently began substituting ground turky and found it much eaiser than cooking and shredding chicken. It has a nicer texture in the dip and tastes the same."
3,Definitely wasn&apos;t what I expected....  probably won&apos;t make again.
4,"I wouldn&apos;t consider this clean eating or low carb however it was good. The flavor was very mild so if you aren&apos;t going to add hot sauce you may need to add more spices. In my opinion if your chicken has been cooking long enough you don&apos;t have to remove it to shred it. It comes apart nicely by just stirring it. Ours was much more ""soupy"" than the photo. It was like a chicken chili. I added sour cream and cheese and served with tortilla chips."
5,"This is a winner! Amazing flavors and the aroma is absolutely sublime. I cooked on Low, expecting to be out all day but came back home mid day...yikes what a test of patience for not getting into the crock pot before cooking time was over. 
                                My husband has his simply with homemade Mexican rice. Mine was in a tortilla topped with cheese and dollops of sour cream with a side of Mexican rice. This is a keeper! Glad I came across your recipe Michelle...
                                P.S. A quick way to shred cooked chicken is to cut breasts in half and place them in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attached. Run on medium (6) speed for 15 to 20 seconds or until the chicken is well-shredded. No stand mixer,then use hand mixer and cut chicken into smaller pieces."
5,"Excellent and easy! I left out the broth  by  mistake but I guess that kept it from being too soupy as some other reviewers mentioned. Had to add a little salt at the end because of that, but nbd. Also left out the cayenne for Hubby&apos;s sake. He gets hiccups when he eats spicy foods! LOL! I was in a hurry and hadn&apos;t planned ahead enough to let it cook for 9 hours, so I cut up the chicken into big chunks, about 4"" each, and cooked it on High for 4 hours. The chicken was fully cooked but still in nice chunks, although it did shred easily if you went at it with a fork. I served it in soup mugs over Mexican rice and the family just loved it! Thanks for posting! (yeah, I know, the rice negated the low-carb thing, but it&apos;s optional! :D  )"
4,"Tweek the recipe to your liking. It&apos;s great base ingredients to start out with! My husband is Mexican so we used red enchilada sauce, and Chipotle salsa in the recipe. alot of cilantro and onions. Topped with tons of Mexican white crumbling queso.(farmers cheese) Thanks."
5,Fantastic dish with such ease to make!! Cooked as directed but I doubled the recepie and added chili powder also used the 32oz. Container of broth! I thought it would be a little more like a soup until I shredded the chicken! Wow! It was very hearty tasty and low carb! Will make again for sure!
5,this is a definite keeper. In place of the seasonings I used a Tbsp of taco seasoning which seemed to work nicely. I ate mine like a dip with tortilla chips and the kids used theirs as burrito filling. This is as &apos;clean&apos; as my eating gets in order to avoid forfeiting flavor... great recipe!
5,"Though I did use chili powder instead of cayenne to temper the heat I made absolutely no other changes. My whole family not only LOVED this but I was asked to officially put it into rotation (that&apos;s what we call my ""go to"" meals that are quick and easy for busy days). As another reviewer said it did turn out more soup like but decreasing the chicken broth (&/or adding more chicken) will change that easily and the soupiness has no bearing on the taste."
5,"Did not use slow cooker at all - made in 20 minutes.  I skipped the broth, used leftover rotisserrie chicken and sub&apos;d the cayenne pepper for some chili pepper and chipotle pepper.  No salt needed.  Served w/ warm tortiallas and a cabbage/green apple salad."
4,"Tasty, easy to add more of your favorite vegetables and make the recipe your own"
2,misleading not low carb.
5,"This recipe is easy and delicious!  I had a package of 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs so that’s what I used.  Followed the recipe exactly except I discovered I had the oven set on 375 instead of 350.  After the 30 minutes mark, I reduced to 350 for the last 15 minutes.  Still turned out great!  Love the lemon flavor.  I will be making again!"
3,"I made it and it was okay, as my husband said, but don&apos;t think he was crazy about it."
5,"I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and I also added fresh mushrooms when I was sautéing the onions. This recipe has great flavor & I definitely make it again."
4,"This was a delicious recipe. The rice was fantastic and the chicken was tasty. The biggest negative for me was that the lemon pepper seasoning burned while browning the chicken thighs, which added some off flavors. When I make this again, I will just salt, pepper, and garlic the thighs and wait to add the lemon pepper with the liquids. Super easy to make too!"
3,"Had to cook 30 minutes uncovered for the rice to absorb liquids, but even after that rice seemed hard and undercooked. Not sure if need more liquid. Have used same rice before in other dishes without a problem. Flavor was good, but not great."
5,"I Loved this!! I made it as written with 3 small changes: Used Bone-in, Skin-on Chicken Drums instead of thighs as that was what I had, and used long grain Brown Rice instead of white, which did require a touch more liquid and a little longer to cook.  I also added frozen mixed vegetables when I pulled it out of the oven for the first stir.  Everything came out perfect! and the seasoning was right on point!  I made it in the quantity published and have a ton of leftovers, which is alright by me as I can do so many things with the cooked rice and veg (Pork fried rice is coming later this week!)!! 
                                
                                I am adding this recipe to my rotation!"
5,"Made it exactly like the recipe stated. Was fantastic! Second time I added a touch less water, so the rice was fluffier. AMAZING!
                                This is definitely going into the weekly rotation for quick and easy meal."
5,Loved it! Made as the recipe said and it was Awesome! Will make again!
4,"Sort of bland. I will make again using more of each spice, lemon juice , and use no water substitute with chicken broth"
5,"I was skeptical when I saw 3 cans of soup go into this and I almost deleted it until I read the 1st reviewer which stated my concerns with the soup and that it would have a processed taste which she stated didn&apos;t. I decided to try it. I used 50% less fat Land of Lakes Margarine to cut down on the fat. It takes a 3 quart or 9 x 13 in casserole dish which isn&apos;t stated in the recipe. I decided to give this a try thinking I would regret it but not only didn&apos;t I regret it I LOVED IT.  It&apos;s fast, easy and it does not have a processed taste which I expected.  I warned everyone ahead of time that it might not be great but it was an easy meal.  Everyone said ""what do you mean it&apos;s not great we love it"". I have to agree.  If you&apos;re looking for a relatively fast easy meal that&apos;s tasty this one is one you might want too consider. No processed taste at all.  It was done in an hour and only prep time really was cutting up the chicken breast. Only change I made was to add some Her*box chicken seasoning (which I think is the best) to the mix.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Most recipes call for the chicken to be cooked prior to baking but this one didn&apos;t and I wasn&apos;t sure about it but after an hour I pulled a chicken bit out of the center and temperature checked it and it was done. My family really liked this and I will definitely be making this again and again.  It&apos;s easy and tasty. If you are in need of a fast and tasty meal this one fits the bill."
5,"I enjoyed this recipe as did the rest of the family. I used long grain white rice. Not instant.
                                Boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast. Substituted the water with chicken broth.
                                Added a cup of sharp cheddar  based on other suggestions.1/8 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp poultry
                                 seasoning. Omitted the salt due to the broth. This was a great simple recipe base , very tasty.
                                Thank you for sharing. I will make it again and again."
5,"My mom made this recipe all the time when I was growing up and I have always loved it.  She made it with a few changes though which is how I prepare it as well.  Instead of two cups of water I use one cup of water and one cup of milk.  I layer the rice on the bottom, then the chicken and then I melt the half stick of butter and mix it in with the rest of the ingredients and pour all of that on top.  Then I sprinkle a thick layer of parmesan cheese on top.  This is my go-to recipe when I bring someone a meal and people always say they love it."
3,"I made a lot of adjustments to get this to be a tasty dinner--used rotisserie chicken, chicken broth instead of water, added poultry seasoning, shredded cheddar cheese, sautéed onions, mushrooms, peas and carrots, and subbed brown rice instead of white."
4,"It was a hit with my family.  I used instant brown rice instead of white. To save time I and add flavor I sauteed some onions, carrots and the chicken cubes before mixing them with the soup, rice & water.  I covered it and it was done in 25 minutes.  Sprinkled parmesean on the top instead of butter and put it in uncovered for 5 minutes."
4,"As is, this recipe is a little bland but good. I made it last night for the second time and made the following changes to liven it up: 
                                *chicken broth(reduced sodium) instead of water
                                *2 cans cream of chicken, 1 cream of mushroom, no cream of celery 
                                *seasoned the chicken with garlic and pepper prior to mixing, I did not add any salt because with the cans of soup and chicken broth this recipe has enough sodium already
                                *used margarine instead of butter and used about half what this calls for (you could get away with not using any)
                                70 minutes was the perfect cook time for me 
                                I garnished this with green onions and peppered bacon (only because I had them in the fridge and they needed to be used). The bacon added great flavor. This is a good recipe as is and a great base to make your own adjustments to."
4,"Added 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, bag of frozen chopped broccoli, and a cup or so of shredded sharp cheddar half in mix half on top. Baked covered covered 40 mins and uncovered 30 and it was done. Also added chicken bullion cube to water and dissolved before adding to mix. Delicious."
5,"I loved this recipe. I was surprised by how yummy it was. I followed the recipe but customized it a little by adding 1/4 tsp each of basil, rosemary, and thyme and 1 tsp of garlic powder and 3 tsp chicken bouillon,   since I had no broth. I also cut the butter in half because I was concerned it would be much too much. Like some of the other reviewers, I sprinkled about 1 cup of cheddar on top. The cheese and butter created the most delicious crust! I was impressed. :)
                                
                                Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely be making this again.
                                
                                Edit: Forgot to mention I used regular long-grain white rice, not instant, if that matters. =)"
5,"First, I brined 2 big boneless, skinless breasts for 24 hours (just 2 C water and 2 heaping T Kosher salt). I cut the chicken into 1"" cubes and placed them in a 9"" x 13"" Pyrex dish. I combined the 2 cups of Uncle Ben&apos;s rice (not instant) with 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom, and a 14 oz can of chicken broth. Poured this over the chicken cubes; dotted the top with slices of margarine (one stick), and about 3/4 C. Panko crumbs. Baked it at 400 covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for another 25 minutes. This is excellent, comfort food at its best! 
                                (and the heck with all the haters just b/c I changed a couple things)
                                Thanks to katie, the original submitter, for a KEEPER! I also posted this on Facebook!"
5,"Oh my goodness!! We had this for dinner last night, whith a roaster chicken instead of hens.  This was unbelievable!  I put some minced garlic in the cavity along with the lemons and rosemary.  I put a mixture of 1/4c, butter, 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, juice from 1 quarter of the lemon and some dried crushed rosemary(I mashed this all together) and put in under the breast skin.  It mad the breast meat super flavorful and tender.  I used minced garlic instead of cloves, and it burnt during the roasting part(425) so if you ar doing the minced garlic, you might want to add part of the wine and broth mixture so that it wont burn.  The gravy was delicious, I did however add a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  Served this with Gourmet Sweet Potato Cassarole(on this site), Basic Yankee Bread Stuffing(on this site), Mashed Potatoes, Green beans, Mushrooms and Cranberries.  I also did as someone suggested to put mushrooms into the juices the last 20 minutes of cooking. What a meal!"
5,"We loved the hens! I halved the recipe and roasted just 2. I used a roaster pan without the lid and found the time specified in the recipe was just right. Like others suggested, I added chicken broth to the garlic in the pan so the garlic wouldn&apos;t burn and that worked well. I also doubled the gravy as others suggested and that was a good idea. Great recipe - it&apos;s a keeper!"
5,"This is the best cornish game hen recipe I have ever found.  It is absolutley wonderful.  Since there are only two in my house, I made two games hens, but left the wine and broth the same (basically the sauce I kept the same) and it turned out perfectly.  If I used four hens, I would double the sauce because when I boiled the sauce down it was perfect for two hens.  ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL.  Thank you for a new favorite, and very moist, game hen recipe...Shannon"
5,"Was actually very easy, and tasted great, BUT....I think you need to cook them a bit longer. (It could be my oven) Break the thigh open and check for doneness. Even though my thermometer read 181, it was still very pink down in the thigh area.  Instead of a roasting rack, I cubed sweet potato and put the hens on top of them to roast. Mmmmmmmm! All of the juices from the hens, oil and lemons drizzled down on them and it was Scrumtious!"
5,"I searched for a long time for a Cornish Hen recipes since I had never made them before, and did I find a winner! It was so easy, flavorful, and juicy! I did make a few modifications, I used 2 hens since it&apos;s just my husband and I, In the cavity of each bird I put a quarter lemon, 2 cloves of garlic and 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary. I read the recipe wrong and actually rubbed 1 tbsp of olive oil on each hen, but still came out good. I then put 1 tbsp butter under the skin on each breast, along with 2 sprigs of the fresh rosemary. I sprinkled some poultry seasoning on each hen along with a lemon slice on the breast and then placed them in my roasting pan on top of cubed yukon gold potatoes. After roasting I took 2/3 c. of cheap pinot grigio, 2/3 c. chicken broth, and about 5 cloves of minced garlic and used that to pour over the hens and baste with. Holy cats was this great! My whole house smelt amazing, and the potatoes were the best I&apos;d ever had! I loved how everything cooked all at once and all I had to do was throw together a salad. My husband raved about this recipe, and picked his hen clean. We loved it so much I&apos;m going to be adapting this recipe to a roasting chicken tonight for dinner. Hope it comes out just as good. Thanks you for sharing a great recipe!"
5,we loved this recipe. I used a whole 4 lb chicken instead of the cornish hens and it turned out great. I did not use the lemons as suggested (did&apos;t have them) so I stuffed the bird with a whole yellow onion quartered and dried rosemary again did not have fresh). I also doubled the white wine/chicken stock mixture. my only suggestion would be to put a little chicken stock in the pan with the cloves of galic at the start so the garlic will not burn.
5,I make this often. I always add extra rosemary and lemons for extra flavor. We like to use the garlic after to spread on bread!!
5,These were tasty! Very simple too- except I was short on time so I cut down on the garlic and didn&apos;t reduce the sauce. I also used dried rosemary and omitted the wine just using extra broth and a little bit of apple juice. These were great for Christmas dinner.
5,"Excellent recipe that I have made at least 6 times and always comes out perfect.  Only two additional recommendations to the recipe is place a little softened butter with minced garlic on top of hen between skin and brest and add a little broth to pan before placing in oven to keep garlic from burning.  Add what ever flavors your family prefers to cavity (onion slices, lemon wedges, garlic, etc.)."
3,This was my first time making any kind of whole poultry (I know!) and the recipe couldn&apos;t have been easier. I definitely added some stock to the pan right away like other suggested and I&apos;m glad I did - the garlic definitely would have burned. I almost tripled the sauce for two hens and had a little bit of sauce left over. Next time I&apos;ll definitely season the inside of the bird before stuffing it with lemon and rosemary.
5,"This recipe is AWESOME with a few modifications. I made it for my mom, husband, 3 year-old and 8 month old and it was a HUGE hit with all of us! My husband liked it better than his grandma&apos;s homemade chicken and dumplings and the gourmet chef who lives next door tasted it and thought it was an old family recipe. :) He loved it! First, you definitly need to add spices. I used cumin, parsley, poultry seasoning, seasoned salt and pepper. Next, I only used 1 can of biscuits, not 2. (I even used the reduced fat version and they tasted the same!) Thirdly, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. Instead of water, I used 3/4 can of low sodium/lowfat chicken broth. At first, it seemed like way to much liquid, but eventually the biscuits soaked it all up! Fourthly, I added 2 CANS of mixed veggies (mix of carrots, peas, tiny potatoes, celery). I am not a fan of canned veggies by any means, but they tasted great in this recipe- so tender! I did add red onion, but I used only half and chopped the pieces extra small. Lastly, I cooked the biscuits for almost 3 hours for a total cooking time of 6.5 hours on high. 30 minutes is just not enough time! Another tip- if you accidentally add too much chicken broth, add a bit of sifted flour and the sauce thickens right up! I know that this recipe will be a winter tradition in our household for years to come!"
5,"Excellent! Only adjustments needed are as follows:  Use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (as directed- don&apos;t deviate with other cream soups) cover with 1 14 oz can of chicken broth (no need to cover with water, dillutes flavor).  Put torn biscuit dough in roughly 90 minutes before ready to serve and make sure that you push them down into the liquid mixture a little, so that they get cooked on the tops, too and saturated with the chicken flavor.  I made this recipe with veggies and without, it was better WITHOUT, because the consistency was better and the veggie flavor soaked into the dumplings. 5 hours on High is MORE than enough total cooking time.  Also, leave chicken partially frozen when starting out and don&apos;t tear meat until right before adding dumplings, this keeps chicken moist.  THIS ONE&apos;S A WINNER!!!!"
5,"Sorry if this get long winded, but I love dumplings. I cant believe how good this recipe is! Ive been raised on my Great Grandma&apos;s recipe from West Virgina, and was sure this would be horrible. It was really good, and I just changed a few things to make it more like Na-Na&apos;s. I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup. I added some celery tops with leaves(removed after cooking). And just so theres no confusion, the biscuits will turn into dumpling (like noodles) NOT drop biscuits like you would expect. The only thing I would do differently would be to roll the dough out into small pancake sizes and cut that into strips. (The dumplings were just a little doughy-er than we are used to.)A little salt and pepper, and  with those changes, this would be as close to the all day version as you can get. My husband could&apos;nt tell the difference! Really good! Thank-you Janiece."
5,"Wonderful recipe.  And for all the morons who simply make a totally different recipe by their additions, subtractions, cooking a bit longer or shorter...try posting your own recipe and stop giving 4 stars to a perfectly good recipe.  All recipes are guidelines.  We all have different tastes, so either like the recipe or leave it.  tiny.mama"
5,I&apos;m giving this 5 stars for it&apos;s easiness and flavor. It tastes close enough to homemade to be really enjoyable. I used 2 cans cream of chicken 1 can chicken broth and 1 & 1/2 soupcans of water to cover 2 FROZEN (helps keep it tender) chicken breasts (just 2 of us). I added the water b/c I was worried about the salt and was glad I did. Cooked on low 8-9 hours adding 1 can biscuits 2 hrs before eating. It was very good! I&apos;m biased b/c I was raised on the best dumplings of all time (my mom&apos;s) so of course they&apos;re not quite homemade but hubby devoured this and I liked it too! The chicken was SO TENDER I was very surprised! I think cooking on low and not cutting up the chicken into chunks before cooking is key so the juices don&apos;t just leak out... they get stored in the breast which u can pull apart later. This is great if you&apos;re learning to cook in college or just in a pinch for a great meal! Simple yummy and comforting! Thanks for a great recipe & quick lifesaver! We barely had leftovers! Leftover chicken could easily be turned into a soup or even enchiladas the next day! UPDATE 8-27-07: Veggies add water so adjust accordingly or skip water altogether. Right before adding biscuits if liquid&apos;s too watery mix a few TBSPNs of flour with cold water & stir into crock pot to thicken. Also cut biscuits into quarters. Cranking up heat to high during biscuit cooking made them cook faster and better - 1 hr instead of 2. So far Pillsbury&apos;s Grands Homestyle Buttermilk biscu
5,This was great! I made changes as suggested by others. I used 8 small breasts used chicken broth instead of water added a bit of white wine (less than 1/4 cup). I seasoned the chicken before cooking with seasoned pepper garlic powder chicken seasoning and paprika. I added fresh celery along with the onion. I added green peas & water & flour for thickening before I added the biscuits. I flattened the biscuits and cut into strips and seasoned with salt & pepper on both sides. Cooked an additional 2 hours on high without opening the lid and it was perfect.
5,"It really irritates me that people give a recipe 5 starts and then proceed to change it so that it&apos;s not even the same recipe anymore.  If you don&apos;t like the recipe as is then don&apos;t give it a high rating - post your own separately somewhere else!  That&apos;s not only rude, but it&apos;s misleading."
5,WONDERFUL!! I used chicken broth instead of water and did not use the onion. Did season with salt pepper and a little onion powder. I put on low in morning before going to work and let cook all day. I shredded the chicken(had used frozen chicken breasts) and turned to high and added 2 cans of biscuits each biscuit into 4 pieces. Let cook 1-11/2 hrs on high. Was absolutely the BEST!!
4,I finally made this recipe today for our Sunday lunch. This was very tasty with my changes. First of all I have the oblong slow cooker so I used 6 small to medium sized breasts first I poured half of a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker then placed the chicken that was seasoned with salt pepper poultry seasoning and paprika then I placed the onions on top then a can of cream of chicken soup can of cream of celery soup then the remaining chicken broth. One hour and 45 minutes before serving I shredded the chicken. Then I put the store brand Texas style regular biscuits that I had quartered on top. One can of 10 count biscuits was plenty! This turned out very well and not too liquidy. This will be great to add veggies to and also for cold days. My 16 year old son ate this up like he hadn&apos;t been fed in years. Thanks for the post!
3,Super Easy! I liked it but my husband didn&apos;t...figures
5,"In a word, WONDERLICIOUS!  I knocked this recipe out of the park on my first try.  Here&apos;s what I did (and what you should do too): in melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots.  Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot.  Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes. Only if you want some creaminess, go ahead and add a half can of condensed cream of whatever soup (whatever flavor you choose).  Voilà! A SIX-star chicken noodle soup!"
5,"Vincenza...I could kiss you for this recipe.  My 15 month old and I had a bad flu and she refused to eat any soup from the can.  I was ill and at my wits end and found this recipe.  I had all ingredients in the house (except for celery) and whipped this together.  I didn&apos;t have the vegetable broth and had to improvise with some chicken broth granules to make all the necessary broth.  I cubed raw chicken and boiled it in the soup to save time.  I also added garlic.  I made egg noodles on the side and added it as we ate it so the soup wouldn&apos;t get starchy.  This soup was not only easy but AMAZING!  Probably the best chicken soup I&apos;ve eaten.  UPDATE:  I&apos;m still eating this on a regular weekly basis.  I make a batch almost weekly and it freezes excellent (if you don&apos;t add pasta to it until you&apos;re ready to serve).  I now ALWAYS use vegetable broth as I really feel it adds to the flavor.  I sautee the celery, onions and carrots along with garlic to soften them up.  I also buy a rotisserie chicken and use the whole thing to make a huge batch of this soup.  I triple all veggies and my 20 month old daughter eats the veggies out of the soup by the handful!  This freezes REALLY well if you don&apos;t add pasta until you&apos;re ready to serve.  This is a definite keeper and is still the best homemade chicken soup I&apos;ve had."
5,"GREAT recipe! A few changes I made are...I sauteed the carrots along with the onion (they end up more tender), I didn&apos;t use any veg broth but all homemade chicken broth (it&apos;s richer), I added minced garlic along with the othe veggies that cook in the butter, and I doubled the noodles (this made it more a chicken & noodles dish but it was delish!).  This is a great way to usue a rotisserie (sp?) chicken on the second day.  I really really recommend this recipe! I also freezes well!"
5,"This is so easy to make and so good!  I cook the chicken breasts in the broth to make the broth a bit richer, then build the soup from there."
5,I used all chicken broth (part homemade & part store bought broth in the box) Used fresh basil and fresh oregano from my garden and threw in some dried herbes de provence(an incredibly versatile herb mixture)Sauteed the sliced carrots with the onion and celery. Made the recipe for 8 and that made generous servings for 6 people. Everyone had 2 bowls. Delicious. Served with big green salad rolls fresh fruit and brownies for dessert.
4,"I followed the recipe only adding 6 cloves of minced garlic. I used homemade chicken broth/vegetable broth and I used the ""No Yolks"" egg noodles. After tasting it I did increase the basil and oregano. This was quick to make and quite comforting for someone who&apos;s been sick for what seems like ages. Next time I&apos;ll increase both the onion and celery as I like a chunkier soup."
5,"My friend told me last week that I needed to check out this web site.  So I did and join the same day.  Today my daughter was sick when she got up.  I got on the web site to find a chicken soup recipe and found a lot of them.  This one is so easy to fix and that&apos;s what I was looking for.  My daughter is not a good eater and when your sick your really don&apos;t feel like eating.  She has  had 2 bowls now.  My husband and I also loved it.  I did put 1 cup of celery, onion, and carrots.  It was so rich and hearty.  Thank you for this submitting this recipe."
5,This was the first homemade chicken noodle soup I ever made. It is VERY GOOD! I was expecting something different than the way it turned out but it is delicious all the same. I did nearly doubly the noodles and I doubled the veggies. The only problem I had was that the noodles lost their spiral shape when the soup was done--they cooked too long. I may cook them separately next time. I have to say...while I am sure there are better recipes out there somewhere this one is quick cheap and easy! And as another reviewer said it makes me not want to buy another canned chicken noodles soup again. And I don&apos;t think that I will unless I have to! I really like this! Good and flavorful!
5,"Excellent chicken noodle soup recipe.  Very easy and has a homemade taste.  I did not cook the chicken first.  I simmered it in the broth with the vegetables for more flavor.  Used frozen egg noodles and added garlic.  Also added two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup for a creamier soup.  I would recommend tasting it before adding salt, it may not be necessary to add salt if not using low sodium chicken broth."
3,Good but nothing extraordinary. Great base to start from. Thanks!
4,"Good basic recipe for stuffed cabbage rolls.  My grandmother was Hungarian, and she used ground pork and beef, but there is much less fat in these.  The only change I made was to spread half a can of sauerkraut in the dish before adding the rolls, and spread the other half on top of the rolls.  Add 1 cup of water to the dish, pour over the tomato sauce and sprinkle a teaspoon of caraway seeds over the top.  Cover and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes.  And there you have it!  You have just changed Polish Cabbage Rolls into Hungarian Stuffed Cabbage!  The sauerkraut makes all the difference in the world!"
4,I loved it!
5,"These turned out great for me, next time I&apos;m going to do stewed tomatoes on top vs. the tomato sauce. The tomato sauce on top was just a little too strong for me. It would be good with a few ounces of tomato sauce in the rice filling too."
4,Very close to my grandma&apos;s recipe. I left out the marjoram and substituted ground chicken with ground beef and it was almost perfect.
3,Pretty good; the straight tomato sauce from the can on top was not my favorite flavor though. It needs more kick or zip or something.
5,so very good! I am trying to go healthy! I used ground chicken and ground turkey. I wished I&apos;d have cooked the cabbage leaves slightly longer but still very good. I minced the garlic as I didn&apos;t remember to smash. I used tomatoes sauce with herbs and garlic flavor. Otherwise followed recipe. SOOOO GOOD
4,Thank you for the recipe JRebel! I ve been trying to recreate my Polish husband s grandmother s cabbage rolls for years. The filling of the cabbage rolls is spot on for using ground turkey! I used a little too much marjoram but it was not overwhelming. We really enjoyed these cabbage rolls. To save some time I cooked the rice in my rice cooker earlier in the day. 2 2 lb ground turkey and 1 medium-large? head cabbage yielded 18 rolls of varying sizes for us. To bake I placed the really small leaves of the cabbage in the bottom of the prepared baking dish (no waste here) and placed the rolls on top. I would rate the cabbage rolls as written 5 stars. The only reason why I m rating 4 stars is because of the sauce. As written there is plenty of sauce for the rolls but we didn t care for the strong tomato sauce flavor. Overall excellent recipe for the mixture! and we froze half of the rolls (unbaked without the sauce lay flat on sheet tray and placed in single layer in Ziploc bags lay bag flat in freezer)! When ready to bake the frozen rolls thaw rolls in fridge overnight transfer rolls to baking dish pour sauce over and bake as directed in recipe. This will be our go to recipe for stuffing the rolls!
4,"These are super easy, as the title implies. I utilized my Instant Pot to steam my cabbage for about 10 minutes, which was a tad too long as the outer few leaves tore apart but I still had plenty of usable leaves. If you happen to not have canned tomato sauce on hand and you’re a gardener a good substitute is home canned stewed tomatoes with a couple tablespoons of tomato paste to make sauce. To cut acidity I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar to my sauce mixture. Also sprinkled in a little Italian seasonings for a little flavor boost to the sauce. These were delicious and very close to a recipe I’ve used for years. The meat mixture was perfect. Although I didn’t do it for this recipe, I have cheated with not rolling the meat mixture with the cabbage, but instead layering chopped cabbage in the bottom of the pan, followed by oblong “meatballs”, sauce, and then more cabbage, topped with remaining sauce to make more of a casserole. Just a tip for those who may dismiss making cabbage rolls thinking it’s too much work. I did use ground beef as the submitter mentions in the cooks notes. I never have ground chicken on hand. Thank you for the tasty recipe."
3,I mixed the soup with water. It deluteed the soup and made great sauce. I take the leafs that weren&apos;t used and cover up the top of the cabbage rolls. The cabbage rolls did not turn brown and burn.
5,"I read every single review (all 114) prior to making this soup, so I changed a few things.  It turned out wonderfully!!  Here&apos;s how I did it:  I diced two boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked them prior to starting with the olive oil, 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 cup diced onion.  Then I added 4 cans condensed chicken broth (many people said the soup was very thick - chili-like consistency, and I wanted more of a soup).  I also added a can of water (filled a broth can with water).  I added the crushed tomatoes (28 oz), the hominy (15 oz), the diced green chili peppers (4 oz), 1 tsp each of cumin (instead of oregano as many reviewers suggested), lime juice and garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  I brought to a boil and let simmer for 1 hour (as others also suggested).  Top with shredded monterey jack cheese and garnish w/ tortilla chips.  EXCELLENT!  My husband said it tasted just like the chicken tortilla soup we&apos;d had at Chili&apos;s - which was what I was aiming for!!  I think the sour cream would have been a good topping as well, maybe next time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
5,"My husband and I loved this soup - it tastes just like the chicken tortilla soup I&apos;ve had at restaurants.  I made the following changes.  I first sauteed cut up chicken breast in a little olive oil, with salt and pepper and garlic powder, and then I shredded the chicken.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, because we love garlic!  I substituted 2 tsp of cumin for the oregano.  I added 2 cans of chicken broth and omitted the water.  I don&apos;t particularly like hominy, so I substituted 2 cups of frozen white corn.  And I didn&apos;t have any canned green chile peppers, so I used half a can of diced jalepenos.  I topped off the soup with Monterey Jack Cheese, crushed tortilla chips, fresh minced Cilantro and a little sour cream .  It was wonderful!  I served the soup with Mexican cornbread (basically cornbread mix to which I added diced jalepenos and 1 1/2 cups of Monterey Jack).  I definitely be making this soup again !"
5,"I can&apos;t say enough good things about this recipe!! Suffice to say that I&apos;ve made it at least 6 times in the past several months.  It&apos;s such a good, hearty soup, and so easy to make. I&apos;ve made it for friends several times and EVERYONE has asked for the recipe. Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve learned: 
                                1) Make sure you use FRESH cilantro.  It truly does make a difference.
                                2) I bake the chicken and chop it up (rather than shredding) using my Pampered Chef hand chopper. REALLY fast and much easier than shredding.
                                3) Eliminate the water and use another can of chicken broth instead.
                                4) Omit the oregano - use 1 teaspoon of cumin (as others suggested) instead.
                                5) Rather than shredding Monteray Jack, I find that Kraft shredded Mexican cheese works just as well and is easier/faster.
                                6) I&apos;ve never had a ripe avacado on hand, and though I&apos;m sure it would be good, it&apos;s not necessary because this soup is already delicious. 7)I add sour cream as an additional garnish."
2,"Not sure if people are rating this recipe based on their personal revisions, but as written this recipe does not deliver. It&apos;s too watery, it needs more time to cook, and it completely lacks in spice/flavor. Luckily I had a couple ingredients on hand to fix it, and the end result was wonderful and the whole family asked to have it again (soon). So I will share my changes:  1) Use shredded chicken - it&apos;s more like what you&apos;d get in a restaurant. 2) Let this soup simmer in a crock pot - I did it on low for a total of 5 hours. It thickens the soup and helps the flavors blend. 3) Substitute the water for chicken broth (I used a total of 3 cups of broth). 4) Skip the hominy - one cup of corn is enough. Add an extra 4oz can of green chilis.  5) ADD A PACKET OF TACO SEASONING (I had McCormick&apos;s on hand) and increase the chili powder by 1 tsp. Add a sprinkle of cumin and a little salt (or garlic salt). 6) Add 8-10 finely crushed tortilla chips (baked are ok) into the soup (they&apos;ll cook down so you won&apos;t have crunchy bites but they add a good flavor - it is TORTILLA soup, right?) 7) After simmering for 4 1/2 hours, stir in 1/2 cup of sour cream. Continue to simmer for 30 minutes. This is what really puts the soup over the top and gives is a creamy texture similar to what I&apos;ve had in most restaurants. 8) Serve with diced avocado, shredded cheese, and more tortilla chips for crumbling.  End result - awesome!"
4,"Not like the tortilla soup I had in Mexico, but very good with some changes other reviewers suggested. I started with the base and it tasted bland so I added cumin and more chili powder (salt and pepper to taste) and let this simmer (after only 10 minutes the tomatoes still taste raw). I recommend an hour.  Towards the end, add the chicken and beans-they only need to be heated through.  I have no clue what condensed chicken broth is, so I used regular broth. I ended up adding 2 more cups of chicken broth, as it was too thick. Topped with cheese, tortilla chips, Franks hot sauce and sour cream and it was pretty and delicious!"
4,So delicious!! I only gave this four stars because this is the second time I&apos;ve made it; the first time I followed the recipe exactly but this time I modified it slightly. My changes made it even better! I used a pre-cooked chicken omitted the oregano and cilantro added 1 tsp cumin and used 1 tsp regular chile powder plus 1 tsp ancho chile powder. It was aMAzing!! I STRONGLY recommend the ancho chile powder to those who can find it...it gave it such an awesome flavor! Next time I may just use all ancho and none of the regular... Will DEFINITELY make again!!
4,"GREAT - We are big soup lovers and make many kinds of soup all year round. My husband, son and I love this soup. I have made this soup at least 4 times over the last year. I usually double the recipe and saute the chicken breasts in a little olive oil with garlic powder and black pepper then shred before adding to the soup just before the simmering step. I also use additional chicken broth instead of water and add 1 jar of salsa. Sometimes I add hominy, sometimes not. I also add cumin and some lemon juice to taste. HOWEVER, I always let the soup simmer for at least a hour or more on low heat to let the flavors come together. This makes it even better the next day. This is very good topped with sour cream, chopped green onions and shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese."
5,We loved this soup! I didn&apos;t add the oregano because that seems like an Italian herb. Instead I added cumin. Be sure to use crushed tomatoes and not whole or chopped. The crushed is thicker the others are too watery.
4,"Excellent lightly spicy soup Star! I think the base flavor needed ""something"" though. The oregano was a little too prominent to me. I added 1/4 cup red wine (boil off the alcohol for a few minutes) Did the trick. WAY GREAT! Oh and I thought it needed to be cooked a little LONGER (10-15 minutes simmering) to blend flavors. If you do don&apos;t add the (we prefer slightly shredded to chunks)chicken until last few minutes or it will be ""mushy"". If you like chili and chicken TRY THIS RECIPE. You won&apos;t even need the toppings-great without too!"
5,"I read the reviews and took the suggestion of some others.  First of all, I dipped the chicken in egg wash, then laid the slices of ham and cheese on top.  I got a plate and sprinkled breadcrumbs and placed the chicken on it and rolled it from there.  I also added a pat of butter on top of each.  It came out beautifully and you must use the sauce (which is 1 can of cream of chicken soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1 tbsp of lemon juice).  I put a bed of white rice on the plates, put the chicken cordon blue on top of the rice covered with the cream sauce. A good side dish is buttered rolls, mmm-mhmm! All I can say was that it was such a beautiful presentation and absolutely heavenly!"
5,"I can&apos;t believe this awesome recipe! My boyfriend cannot stop talking about it. I told him I was making it for dinner, and he came home early from work. Then, when he tasted it......he moaned and groaned through the entire meal. He made a comment between each and every bite. He has thanked me over and over for making this for him. I have to say, this recipe made me &apos;Queen for a Day.&apos; I also dipped the chicken in egg before sprinkling the bread crumbs, and I, too, added a small pat of butter on top of each of the breasts. I will definetely be making this, at least once a month. I used the &apos;potatoe rounds&apos; recipe from this site, for the side dish. This entire meal turned out soooooooo good. You are a goddess, Kiersten! Thank you so much.  :)"
5,"Fantastic. My variation includes: add some paprika to the breading, and bread the whole chicken roll, not just the top. I also like to cook my chicken hotter and faster to keep it juicy - 20-25 minutes at 400. Final suggestion: add the honey-mustard sauce from this site&apos;s Aussie Chicken recipe (inside the roll and/or as a dipping sauce). It really complements this dish!"
5,"This recipe was absolutley amazing and very easy. I did follow some of the suggestions from previous raters(Mushroom soup sauce:1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream & 1 tbsp of lemon juice-served on top when finished; coated chicken in egg before adding bread crumbs; cooked at 400 for 25 min and I also added a small pat of butter to each breast before cooking). I would also suggest not to use sandwich ham. Anyway, my boyfriend wants to marry me after tasting this recipe! Thanks!"
4,Very good!  I can NEVER get breasts thin enough to roll so I cut breasts in half almost all the way through and laid a piece of Healthy Choice Ham and provolone in the cut; sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on bottom of dish; laid chicken on top and then sprinkled more bread crumbs on chicken.  Very tasty!
5,Great recipe to make ahead and freeze too! I dip the rolled up chicken in melted butter before rolling in bread crumbs.
5,"Wow!  These were looked and tasted wonderful and they were super simple to make.  I bought big breasts and pounded them.  They were quite easy to roll.  I dipped them in egg first and then rolled them in the bread crumbs. I used the other reviewers suggestions and used provolone instead of swiss (just my preference), put a pat of butter on top of each and baked for 25 minutes at 400 degrees.  I put a half slice of cheese on top and put it back in for 5 minutes.  I also made the sauce recipe (1 can of cream of celery soup, 1/2 cup of sour cream) and spooned it on top.  Just lovely - thanks so much for a great recipe."
5,A hit in my family of 5 including a 4 yr old the pickiest of all...The chicken cooked for 50 minutes..adding to its crispiness..and I didn&apos;t use toothpicks to secure them making them easier to eat. I used sliced cooked ham and processed swiss cheese to cut costs and found it to be a bit salty. I will try this again and again however I will cut down the amount of salt. It was totally simple to prepare! TY
5,"I just want to say this is the first thing I have ever truly made with no help from someone in the kitchen.  My boyfriend and I were going to go out to dinner for his birthday and the night before, he decides, he wants a homecooked meal from yours truly instead. I freaked out and googled what to make. He then suggested ""steak, lobster or chicken cordon bleu"" He knew I was NOT making steak or lobster :) Don&apos;t laugh (i&apos;ve been living under a rock) but I had no idea what chicken cordon bleu even was! I have cooked before but honestly, before I made this, I had NEVER made a meal (from scratch) by myself.  Again, don&apos;t laugh!   Basically, all I am saying is:  This recipe was sooooooo easy and it was absolutely delicious and I am now an allrecipes member because of how much fun I had cooking all by myself.   Thank you!"
1,The chicken was dry despite correct cooking time. Perhaps a light sauce could have been served with it. I would not make this a 2nd time.
5,"Your basic chicken soup recipe found in most general cook books. It is the old reliable of chicken soup recipes. I appreciated the hint to cut the carrots, celery and onions in half. I had always cut them up in small pieces, and then when I would drain the broth, it was messy to try to retrieve the cut up veggies to put them back in the broth. This is so much easier! When I drain the broth, I place a paper towel in the sieve. It makes for a nice clear broth. I also cook up some noodles to add to the soup. I do not like to add the noodles directly to the pot of soup, because the noodles will aborb too much of the broth."
3,"I give this a three as written. But with changes it moves up to a four. I added some fresh herbs, and did not use the veggies that were in the stock, because the veggies had lost all of there flavor. I used freshly chopped veggies. Then I added 2 cups of water with 2 cubes of chicken bouillon."
5,"Absolutely wonderful recipe! I used about 2 1/2 lbs. of cut up chicken and used 4 packets of Goya Chicken Bouillon and I think that probably was the secret to seasoning this soup.  I used baby carrots and put two whole (scrubbed with the peel on) potatoes in the bottom of the pot with chicken.  I followed the instructions and let it cook, took the chicken off the bone and returned everything to the pot after I cut up the veggies.  I then added some frozen vegetable soup cut veggies (celery, peas, onion, potatoes, okra, etc.) and ditalini pasta.  My son has a cold and this soup really hit the spot with him, even in 110 degree weather! I really recommend this soup recipe!  I put half in individual containers in our freezer and my son, who wants soup every day, will be set for at least a few days!"
4,"This recipe is very tasty though it is also very basic - which is perfect for the beginner chef.  Once you begin to ""doctor"" your own recipes, you will see that the more flavors you add to chicken broth, the better. For example, why stop with carrots and celery? In addition to these things, I add a potato, tomato, fresh basil, fresh parsley, red peper, onion, etc... Make sure to be generous with the salt as stock can be quite bland unless seasoned appropriately. I even use a couple of bay leaves and a couple of peppercorns during the cooking process.  Bring the liquid to a boil, then turn the heat down and simmer. I use a lid on my soup to keep evaporation to a minimim, though I ""vent"" the lid with a wooden spoon during cooking (kind of props up the lid) so that it isn&apos;t completely sealed shut...  Add water 1/2 way through cooking if necessary.  Boullion is OK, but not necessary if you have the appropriate blend of chicken, veggies and herbs.  Serve with rice or your noodle of choice.  Never cook noodles in the broth - always in a separate pot because the starch will ruin your soup. The more you times you make this recipe, the more you will enjoy it - as it is definitely a process of trial and error. ENJOY!"
5,"Wonderful soup, I cooked the soup w/out carrots & potatoes most of the day, adding them in the last hour.  For a little extra taste I added some cumin.  The whole family loved it, great for a blustery and rainy day here in the great northwest!"
4,"Pretty good soup. I used a roasted chicken carcass from our previous nights dinner as I feel it adds more flavor then the uncooked chicken. I also used canned chicken broth in lieu of the water, along with my usual seasonings. We&apos;re eating a lot of soup these days as it&apos;s frigid here in northwest N.J.! Thanks Jill!"
5,"Yummy. I followed the recipe as written - and at the end - added ""uncooked star shaped pastas"" and cooked an additional 10 minutes - making it Homemade Chicken Soup with Stars. I submitted a photo of the finished project."
5,This is a great recipe to work with as your base for your own chicken noodle soup. I usually follow the general idea of it to make my stock adding a bunch of garlic and a couple other spices. Then I add my own veggies to the soup. If you like beans in your chicken soup add beans. Basically add whatever you enjoy!
5,"This was the first time making Chicken Soup from scratch and I was surprized at how simple it was. My husband wanted homemade noodles with it so I used Pat&apos;s recipe for ""Basic Pasta"" and it turned out GREAT! We added the noodles to the soup and let them boil for about 15 minuites and served. I saved the leftovers and they tasted even better the second time!!! I also added a bit more water while the chicken was boiling. I will definatly be making this again!"
5,OH BOY!  This is REAL Chicken Gravy!   Don&apos;t be afraid to cook your roux - if needs to be cooked slowly to a blonde stage - like Chef John says it will smell like pie crust.   Good chicken stock makes a huge difference with this gravy.  I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the roux along with some white pepper.  Then proceeded as directed....taste tasted and added a bit more.  Will I make again?  You bet!
3,"Just ok.  I dont know if the cream was a good addition.  It was looking beautiful (color and texture) before i added the cream.  It lost the ""look"" of what i consider chicken gravy.  Easy recipe for the novice though"
5,This recipe was delicious. I used half and half instead of heavy cream because I didn&apos;t have any.
5,I really enjoyed this recipe. I&apos;ve never bought gravy mixes and have always tried my hand at homemade gravies but they&apos;ve never come out this good. I&apos;ve always used oil and never butter and I think that that makes all the difference. I didn&apos;t use cream as I did not have it and the gravy was just as good. I did add a little bit of whole milk though. I will definitely use this time and time again. I know it was good because my husband enjoyed it and he is picky picky picky!! Thanks!!
5,Excellent easy recipe. I didn&apos;t have the cream added just a touch of milk and a little bit (about a teaspoon) of cornstarch. I also added a few dried parsley flakes and a tiny bit of sage. Just mainly for color and because I was serving it with a sage stuffing. Thanks for a great recipe.
4,This is a good basic well-written recipe for gravy that will appeal to all those who either have never made gravy or who aren t confident preparing it. I used the drippings from a roasted turkey breast plus enough boxed chicken stock to make up the difference. The cream was a nice addition something I don t generally use. I didn t care for the light color of the gravy however particularly since I was using it for sliced roast turkey but a little dribble of Kitchen Bouquet fixed that right up.
5,"Mmm, amazing! So good with our roast chicken and mashed potatoes. My gravy wasn&apos;t getting thick at a simmer so I increased the heat and brought it to a low boil whisking constantly (this is how my mom does it) until it was thick to my liking, then turned off the heat and added the cream, s/p and cayenne. Thanks so much for the recipe:)"
5,"This is similar to the old Fanny Farmer chicken pot pie gravy recipe.  I add a touch of poultry seasoning to mine and a dash of nutmeg.  I then pour it over roughly cubed chicken, drained can of LeSeur peas, carmelized onion pieces and well-cooked sliced carrots.  A topping of Bisquick biscuits finishes it off, with a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese over the biscuits.  There usually aren&apos;t any leftovers!"
3,"Made this gravy tonight. The texture is very nice and it has a nice shine to it. However both my husband and I thought it was somewhat bland and maybe even a little ""flour-y"" tasting. There was something missing. It needs some zing. Like maybe drippings from the chicken roasting pan?? Does anyone have an answer. It looks like we are the only ones complaining about this. Thanks much."
5,"OMG, this is exactly what I was looking for.  It&apos;s restaurant quality.  The sauce is SO SO good and I think adding the lemon slices early on really makes it POP like you suggested with a beautiful fragrance and taste.  My family was very impressed.  UPDATE:  Made this for my husband&apos;s business client and he asked for the recipe to take home.  Also, someone said they thought the sauce was too acidic.. adding lemon slices in at the end only heightens the acidity, not tempers it.  I happen to love the taste of lemon like this, but that&apos;s just me.  Try adding some white wine to the first reduction, then add the chicken broth and go from there.  That might help."
5,"When I make this recipe, I use Italian flavored bread crumbs, instead of flour, to dredge the chicken.  Also pound the chicken breasts out a little so they cook faster.  I use white wine instead of chicken broth for the sauce.  This sauce really requires some tasting to check for tartness as it reduces.  If it&apos;s too tart, add a small amount of sugar starting with a tsp.  Chicken Picata is probably my favorite chicken dish and it&apos;s truly elegant and &apos;company&apos; worthy."
5,"This dish is superb.  Very light, low fat and the sauce has a lemon infusion that is simple, yet elegant.  The lemon slices really do make a difference.  Be sure you&apos;re adding them early or your sauce could be a bit more bitter.  The oil from the rind of the lemon adds a tremendous lemony lift!  I am adding this dish as an option to my menu for my clients.  They&apos;d pay good money for this.  I agree with the others - it is definitely restaurant quality right at home!"
4,The reason that this might taste bitter is because the white pith of the lemon when simmered becomes very bitter.  You could just use a vegetable peeler and peel off just the yellow of the lemon
4,"I have not made this yet.....some quick thoughts.  To stop the bitterness do not add the lemon slices to cook with the sauce, use lemon zest and finish with the butter, the white pith is what is making it bitter.  Add lemon slice when serving.  I also am going to try grilling the chicken and making just a quick lemon pan sauce with shallots, white wine, perhaps a riesling or pinot grigo and garlic, however; no chicken broth.  I would not cut into medallions leave in breasts in tact.  To thicken maybe a little cornstarch and water if necessary.  I will let you know how it turns out.
                                After making this, the grilling part probably not needed, pan frying would have been fine.  The sauce I made was great only wish it had made more.  Cornstarch not necessary.  But a great recipe!"
5,"This recipe was delicious with some modifications.  I gave it 5 stars because I think it would have been good without the modifications too... I just never cook exactly by any recipe.  Here is what I did differently... I pounded out the chicken but did not cut it in medallions.  I pan fried it in a cast iron skillet using olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  After the chicken, I wiped out the pan and added a little more olive oil and some margarine (I have a dairy allergic person in my family so no butter).  I added 2 cloves of garlic then a 1/2 lb of thinly sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  After the mushrooms released their juices, I added the liquid.  I used 2 cups of good chicken stock plus 1/2 cup of a reisling.  I also double the lemon juice and left out the lemon slices.  I zested one lemon into the sauce and saved the lemon slices for plate garnish.  When correcting seasoning at the end, I added a generous amount of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and a pinch of raw sugar.  I served the chicken with the extra sauce over mini bow tie pasta.  All three of my kids ate this and my husband gave it a thumbs up and I loved it.  I would definitely make this one again!"
4,"Perfect. Well, almost. I pounded the chicken breast first; really makes it tender. It takes less time to cook, so it doesn&apos;t get tougher and drier on the outside..."
3,"Wow, I do not know what I did wrong?  I love chicken piccata.  I followed the recipe exactly.  But, the sauce was so bitter!!! Maybe, the lemons I used were the problem?  I loved the cooked chicken before adding the sauce. It was both tender and crispy.  I tried to fix the sauce by removing the lemon slices and adding white wine and a little extra butter.  I served with rice and the person I ate dinner with ate all of theirs, but I couldn&apos;t get over the bitter bite still lingering.  Although, he did not seem to notice for some reason. Make sure you use really fresh lemons!  I believe that could have been the issue, but not sure? Great sauted chicken either way."
5,excellent. Very light  even with the butter at the end. No bitterness from the lemon slices because I took them out after the first 7 mins of boiling.
5,"If I&apos;m going to review a recipe it will only be if I stayed true to the instructions. I can&apos;t justify giving a bad review after writing about all the changes I made. Well guess what?  This recipe is freakin great! Every bite was like a party in my mouth. Young and old, everyone enjoyed it. The leftovers were even better the next day. DON&apos;T CHANGE A THING."
5,"Absolutely delicious.  We cut the chicken breasts into large cubes, which worked very well.  Reduced salt by 1 tsp overall.   Highly recommend this recipe."
5,"Great recipe.  I made one big change, though.  Because my husband is from southern India, I cook up a TON of Indian dishes.  To this recipe, I added 11 fresh small green chiles (chopped).  The chiles make it much more authentic and tasteful, especially if you love genuinely spicy food!  Hope this helps!"
5,"This always turns out great and gives me a wonderful feeling of satisfaction throughout the experience...be warned though, lay out and measure all the ingredients before turning on the burner!"
5,"Outstanding- I no longer need to order out for Indian!  I could not get my hands on garam masala on short notice, but the meal was phenomenal even without it.  Had to use thigh meat because this was a last minute choice and I had no time to run to the store- it was just perfect!"
4,"I made this last night and it came out really good.  The one main change I made was that I used boneless chicken breast and thigh meat.  I also cut the meat up prior to cooking.  Other than that, I used 1/2 coconut milk and 1/2 yogurt."
5,"Great recipe! It was my first time making curry and turned out great! I had to tweak the ingredients a bit due to not having everything available, but still turned out delicious! Fiance went back for seconds, so it was a sure hit.  For my version, I used ground ginger instead of fresh (maybe 1/8 tsp or so) and put it in with the rest of the spices right before simmering. I used dried cilantro flakes instead of fresh. I increased the curry to 1 1/2 Tbsp since we like the curry flavor. I couldn&apos;t find any plain yogurt, so I used a mixture of 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup coconut milk (with a bit of sugar added). I also used 1/2 cup coconut milk instead of water. For the garam masala I used the &apos;Easy Garam Masala&apos; recipe found at this website. It makes enough for multiple batches of curry. I also added two potatoes cut into bite-size pieces. This increased the cooking time by about 20-30 minutes, although next time I will add the potato in with the onion to save time. Next time I would also like to try some mushrooms in the curry.  Overall a great recipe, and would make it again and again! Next time will be with shrimp. 5 stars."
5,This dish was really delicious. I made it for my girlfriend tonight and we both loved it. The gravy was incredibly flavorful and the dish tasted like something that you would get at a good Indian restaurant.
5,"Very very good and authentic tasting. I put everything, except the lemon and yogurt, in the slow cooker on high for about 4 hours. I even threw the chicken in there frozen! After the first 4 hours, I added the yogurt and cooked about another hour. I forgot to add the lemon juice, but next time would do so just before serving.  I used greek yogurt and did not add water or use oil but used twice the amount of crushed tomatoes. I also used only 1 teaspoon of salt, which was plenty. I think the slow cooker method made it very flavorful, moist, healthier and easy."
3,I found this to be incredibly hot and strangely bitter.
5,It was awesome but I added 1/4 cup louisiana chicken wing sauce and 1 teaspoon of onion powder. Best wings yet
5,"Cooked in slow cooker for 2 hours. I used the same amount of oil and spices but only 4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs. It turned out very good and it was so simple!"
4,the recipe turned out exactly as promised.  It was really delicious! A big hit with everyone!
5,"I used 2 Tbsp olive oil, plenty of minced garlic, 2 Tbsp Frank&apos;s hot sauce, and the called for amounts of everything else. Oh, and a tsp of onion powder.  I marinated the wings in all of the above for 2 hours, then baked them on my tin-foil-covered cookie sheet for just under an hour.  My buffalo-wing-loving husband said he definitely wants me to make them again. (His rating was 4 1/2 stars, because he&apos;d never give anything a ""perfect score""...but for him, this is as close as it gets. :)  The skin had just the right crispness, but the meat was definitely not dried out.  We had ranch, more Frank&apos;s hot sauce, and celery on the side."
5,My mom makes these wings all the time and the other day I got a huge craving for them and couldn&apos;t get a hold of her for the recipe. Thankfully it was right here! I also used this for drum sticks and they came out great and in the same amount of time. I also put some wing sauce on some after I took them out and that made them even better.
4,My family really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing that I would do differently is allow the chicken to marinate for a few hours before cooking.
5,My husband LOVED these wings! I didn&apos;t get to try any myself because I was dieting but when I asked him what he thought of them he told me they were they were the best he&apos;s had!
5,"I ate more of these than I should have. Easy.  Will recommend these ones to a couple of people.  YUMMY YUMMY, I had too many chicken wings in my tummy."
4,"Great!  My husband hates bake chicken, but I convinced him that these wouldn&apos;t be the same and he loved them.  I&apos;m"
3,Easy and pretty tasty but nothing special.
5,"This fried chicken receipe is absoultly fantastic,if you take your time get all your ingredients together in two groups,it is easy to make. It smells so good while it is cooking,and the taste is truly unbelievable.And so moist and juicy.I will make this receipe over and over.Thanks Chef John for sharing. The receipe looks intimidating but it isn&apos;t.   Try it you will see how easy it is,and the taste is the best fried chicken ever."
5,"Fabulous recipe, Chef! This is the way fried chicken should be made. I had to make acidified buttermilk (1 tablespoon of lemon juice per 1 cup of milk, allow to curdle for 10 minutes), but the preparation, to me, was effortless. Unfortunately, I didn&apos;t have enough oil for my dutch oven, so I used my skillet, turn the chicken over once after 10 minutes, cooking for 25 minutes total. Also I only had corn oil. I&apos;ll try peanut oil next time. Thanks again!"
4,"This was not a difficult recipe. I did use boneless chicken and followed everything else. I worked fine. This is not the BEST fried chicken I have had, but it was tasty and nice and crispy. I did not need 2 cups of buttermilk, so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good. The rest of the ingredients I used the same. I used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and brown."
5,"This is absolutely the best fried chicken recipe ever! The outside is crispy & the meat is moist & tender. I made it exactly as directed except used boneless, skinless breasts, cut into thirds. My husband wants me to make this again (like tomorrow) & I&apos;m happy to obilige.  Thank you for this terrific recipe!"
5,"LOVE this recipe, my whole family love it. I made little bit healthier by put this chicken in the oil for 3 minutes or until little bit brown on the outside and put the chicken in 350 F oven for 30 - 40 minutes or until the chicken all cooked."
5,"I like this recipe when I saw the video.  However, when I saw the nutritional information, I groaned.  Of course, I knew fried chicken was high fat, but seeing it print detered me from making it.   I decided to use the ingredients and make oven fried chicken.   I use all the ingredients except the oil.   After coating the chicken with the seasoned flour, I sprayed it with PAM.   I used a non stick baking pan.  The results were wonderful!!"
3,"Really great after alterations. I can say with confidence that this would not have been as good without the changes. I doubled all the spices and seasonings (except salt, which I kept the same). The end result was perfectly flavorful, which to me means that it would have been bland with the written amounts. Also, I cooked the chicken between 275 and 300 degrees, and they were perfectly brown at 19 minutes cook time. The breasts were slightly dry, they should have been taken out earlier. The dark pieces were amazing, though."
5,"Oh, yes!  truely scumpious, wonderful herb blend.  I did brown, then put on rack as directed.  However, I put the chicken in a 325 degree oven with the rack over a lipped cookie sheet and baked for 1/2 hour instead of the second frying.  It removed a lot of the grease.  Still crispy the next day, every bit as good as Day 1.  This will be a go to recipe for me."
5,"I followed the directions exactly, except I used my heavy electric skillet.  Perfect!  My husband said it was the best fried chicken he had ever had!  It was incredibly moist and  flavorfull with really crispy crust."
4,I like the addition of the honey and Dijon it&apos;s like putting a honey mustard dipping sauce on the inside. I cooked up 5 chicken breasts which I flattened to all the same thickness. I wouldn&apos;t have had any more egg mixture left for a 6th one..let alone 12 . I would double that if making the full batch.
5,Skip the oil and go for the healthy alternative of baking... Depending on how thick the chicken is after you pound it bake at 400 for 15 - 20 mins.  Use  an elevated rack so it comes out crispy. Used Italian bread crumbs. The wife freaking loved it !!
5,"Very good.  I used Italian breadcrumbs because its all I had, but did everything else by the recipe.   Will definitely make it again"
4,Delish! My family loved it - i suggest using low sodium soy sauce and spicy brown mustard. Will be making this again!
4,"I thought this was quite good. I made pork schnitzel before, but prefer chicken. I left off the salt and lemon wedges."
5,I cut the recipe to two servings using one package of Costco&apos;s organic boneless skinless chicken breasts cut horizontally. I started to run out of the mixture to dip the chicken in so if you want to double dip I&apos;d suggest doubling that part---or at least half again as much. We really liked the flavor of the breading because I did fry it in coconut oil and then rather than use lemon for serving we used a little drizzle of coconut white balsamic vinegar (yum) on top. We have some leftovers that will become a sandwich tomorrow night for our dinner. Thank you for a very welcome change for our dinner tonight!
4,I&apos;ll make this again but probably will try a spicy brown mustard instead...
5,"This dish was easy to make and quick to clean up.  The schnitzel was well-coated and came out crisp, not mushy (is that a real word??), and flavourful.  A winner in my book.  My Mom didn&apos;t even waffle...no wishy-washy its was OK but a resounding ""Yes, we need to make it again""."
5,Easy and delicious.
5,"This is a really good one!!!  Definitely double the sauce.  Here is what I did differently.  Used lite soy sauce to cut the salt, increased the garlic, used 1 tsp. minced fresh ginger.  A lot of reviewers said to half the amount of sugar but I tasted it and felt I needed to add more but not the whole amount.  Since I doubled the sauce, I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  I lined my pan with heavy duty foil then poured most of the thickened sauce over bone-in thighs (skin removed) and some boneless breasts but reserved a little.  Cooked, covered with foil for 30 minutes, removed foil, poured remainder of sauce over and bake another 20-30 minutes.  Wow.  Really good! Update: I made this again using slices of tri tip and it was great.  Fantastic with salmon.  I had a large fillet and basically baked it the same way but reduced the oven temp. to 375 and baked for a little less time till fish was flakey."
5,Delicious!  I substituted 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and dumped all the sauce on top prior to cooking.  I also used an 8x8 baking dish and cooked at 400 degrees for 35 mins.  It turned out GREAT!
5,Absolutely wonderful! The recipe didn&apos;t mention it but I decided to cover the pan with foil to help keep the chicken tender. And I used lite soy sauce too. I think I may decided to line the pan with foil too the next time I make it--otherwise you have a sticky black mess. Delicious flavor and the chicken was so tender. Will definitely make again.
5,Excellent. After reading several reviews I did make the following changes: Doubled the sauce. In the doubled recipe I doubled the garlic (fresh pressed) reduced sugar by half and used packed brown sugar instead of white sugar used lite soy sauce (I always use lite regular is TOO salty) rounded the tablespoons of cornstarch used fresh ground pepper (five pepper blend) and I had boneless skinless thighs. I baked at 375 degrees 25 mins covered with foil then 15 mins uncovered (total 40 mins). I did not baste but just covered the thighs with the sauce. Would&apos;ve used fresh ground ginger if I&apos;d had it. Cleanup was a breeze as long as I soaked pans right away it washed right out. With these changes it was scrumptious and got rave reviews from my family. Great with thighs would also try breasts or other cuts. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Marian!
5,"I make this recipe in a slow cooker and it is simply fantastic. I just put the chicken thighs in, cover with the sauce (exact recipe)and put it on low for at least 5 hours.  The longer the chicken cooks the more savory the dish, and the chicken just falls apart (shreds) in the sauce.  About an hour before I&apos;m ready to serve I throw in some chopped green pepper, carrots, celery (or whatever vegetables I want to get rid of in the fridge), and then 20 minutes before serving I throw in a can of drained pineapple chunks. The pineapple removes the saltiness and the dish is perfect spooned over rice.  Absolutely amazing! I find this recipe foolproof --today I tripled the sauce (made 20 thighs), dropped the bowl and lost most of the sauce all over myself and the floor (GOD what a mess!) and was too lazy to make more so just used whatever was left.  It STILL came out perfect!!  And if the sauce is too thin I just remove some from the crockpot, add a little cornstarch paste and/or Veloutine gravy thickener, microwave it till it boils and thickens and mix it back in with the rest. Too easy!  Thank you for an unforgettable recipe that everyone loves!"
5,Fantastic!!! This has become a favorite in my house. The only changes I make is using boneless skinless chicken breasts and I do cut the soy sauce down a bit and I substitute some of the white sugar for brown sugar to cut down on the saltiness because my husband thought it was a bit too salty. Also do cut the temp down on this. I go 375 for the first 15 minutes or so and then down to 350 for another 20-25 minutes. Continually baste to get that yummy glaze. Terrific recipe!!! Definately 5 &apos;s!!!
5,"What a great homemade teriyaki sauce! It has a much richer taste than many bottled. The only thing I changed was I used a ""low-sodium"" soy. To make a meal I added fresh snow peas sliced water chestnuts squares of yellow onion and green pepper and fresh pineapple chunks. We put over white rice. It was as good as a very good oriental restaurant&apos;s! We did not like the chicken thigh dark-meat with the bone in much though so next time I will make with chicken breast BONELESS SKINLESS thigh meat shrimp or pork. Thank you Marian this sauce is a keeper!"
5,This recipe is totally awesome. You owe it to yourself to try it. I took the advice of other reviewers and I cooked the chicken at 375 degrees. The teriyaki sauce is best I have ever had. I doubled up on the sauce for basting purposes. I used chicken breasts and cut them in strips and served on top of brown rice which was cooked in chicken broth cooked onions and a dash of soy sauce. Thanks MARIAN
5,Loved the sauce although I do plan to reduce the amount of sugar next time. Poured the sauce over chicken breasts which had been pounded to about 1/2-inch thickness. Baked at 375 for 30 minutes turning the chicken pieces over halfway through. Everyone raved about it even my 2-year-old: yummy yummy!
3,This was ok but not great. I used boneless skinless breasts and baked for 30 min. basting and turning every 10 min. My husband liked it. I thought it was too salty even though I used low-sodium soy sauce.
5,"Wonderful dish, used artcat&apos;s  idea and put pepperjack cheese on top - nice touch to a good dish. Thank you artcat - as for Doug_B there is nothing on this site that says you ""have"" to try a recipe - if you look at the ingredients and don&apos;t like them then just move on, there is absolutely no call to be rude."
4,"This is a pretty good version of a truly ubiquitous dish of Texas. Sort of an ""inside joke""--the King Ranch is one of the biggest ranches in the world. They raise CATTLE, not CHICKENS! So it really has nothing to do with the King Ranch, per se.    Here&apos;s a tip. Don&apos;t worry about finding or using fresh corn tortillas. I always have those on hand, but King Ranch Casserole is best made with tortilla chips. Yep--Tostitos, Santitos, even Doritos! They will soften up in the sauce & provide a good corn flavor. I&apos;ve never, ever used actual tortillas."
4,Great recipe with unlimited ingredient changes per your individual tastes.
5,Wow. I haven&apos;t made this dish in ages. This particular recipe and there are lots of them out there surpasses any I&apos;ve had before. It might be a little more work but it&apos;s totally worth it. The only change I made was putting a final layer of 6 deli slices of pepper jack cheese before baking. Yum!!!!
4,"I also shy away from the condensed soups, but this is a great recipe and all you have to do to make your own is increase the oil to about 1/3 cup (I actually use butter!), cook your onions in that and when they are soft, add about 1/3 c. flour, stir and brown it a few minutes and add about 2 1/2 cups of milk/chicken broth and make your own sauce. Yummy, and homemade."
5,"I haven&apos;t made this recipe in years, but as soon as I saw it, knew I had to pull out my recipe book,will be making it again real soon. As for those who hate anything to do with condensed soup, get off your high horse! You don&apos;t know what you are missing. Better still, get off the site."
5,Wow.  The seasonings & spices made this a perfectly delectable dish. This really was very tasty with or without using canned soup (I tried it both ways & enjoyed it both times)... and I am sending my thanks to Chef John for once again giving us another option for a great-tasting chicken casserole. :)
4,"I made this recipe exactly as stated, since that&apos;s the only way to really give it a fair shot. (I don&apos;t put much stock in reviews that don&apos;t evaluate the actual recipe!) Honestly, the flavor is good. my only complaint was the texture. There needs to be something in there with some crunch. Maybe I cut the chicken into pieces that were to small. It would have been better if the peppers or onions had maintained some of their crunch. I&apos;ll try it again and maybe not saute the onion and peppers. Or perhaps garnish the top with crushed corn chips. It just needs something to give it more structure. But again, the taste is great!"
5,"Hubby & I loved this! Changes I made:  mix of red and yellow onion, low fat/sodium version of the condensed soups, light sour cream, only 1 tsp of cumin, twice the amount of chili powder, 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. of onion & garlic powders, a Tbsp. of minced garlic with the peppers & onions, several grinds of black pepper and sea salt, 1-2 Tbsp of Frank&apos;s Red Hot Wings Buffalo sauce, couple dashes of Tabasco. Believe it or not, it wasn&apos;t very spicy-hot after all that. But it definitely needed something, since I was using the healthier soups. That&apos;s the great thing about this recipe-- you can make it your own! I also added some tortilla chip pieces on top of each serving for added crunch."
3,"I gave it 3 stars is because it&apos;s a good generic recip. I myself prefer to substitute chopped green chiles for the RoTel or other brand of tomatoes and chiles, making it more a &apos;green&apos; as oposed to &apos;red&apos; casserole and use only white cheeses like jack or asadero or a combination of the two and going with the green chile powders with the exception of cooking the chicken with a little red chile."
4,"This recipe was really good. I modified it a bit. I did not use cooking cherry, I used 3/4 of a cup of marsala wine instead. I used twice the mushrooms and after I browned the chicken I removed it from the pan and cooked the mushrooms and some shrimp and them added a little heavy whipping cream and reduced it to make a marsala cream sauce and then I added the chicken back and served it over garlic and basil fettuccine. It turned out awesome. I have work in a few 5 star restaurants and had chicken and veal marsala in a lot of restaurants and this is the closest I have gotten the dish to taste myself!!"
5,"oh my gosh this dinner was amazing!  Not only that, but incredibly easy. I made a few changes, as usual, and everyone -loved- the results.
                                1- To make it easier to clean up, i put the flour, salt, pepper, and oregano in a resealable plastic bag, then added the pounded chicken and shook it up (one breast at a time) to coat. It&apos;s just easier and cleaner that way.
                                2- When browning the chicken breasts, i added a few sliced cloves of garlic. mmm
                                3- I doubled the sauce, probably trippled the mushrooms (the more the merrier, right?) and then thickened it with a slurry (water-cornstarch mixture) at the end so we could enjoy it over the angelhair pasta i served it on. So good.
                                4- i added a splash of heavy cream and a splash of chicken broth to the sauce, to make it richer and creamier, like i&apos;m used to Chicken Marsala being.
                                
                                as other users suggested, buy good Marsala wine. It&apos;s really not all that expensive, especially if you compare it to how much it costs to eat out at a nice italian restaurant. ;)"
5,"I&apos;ve been using this recipe for about 5 years now and from the first time I made this, it&apos;s been nothing short of excellent.  I made it this past weekend at a dinner party for somewhere between 25-30 people and everyone loved it as does everyone I&apos;ve ever made this for.  
                                
                                I tend to spend a little more time on prep work because I&apos;m very picky about my chicken, and I take time to trim off as many of those little fatty pieces as possible prior to pounding it out flat.  Sometimes that one chewy bite of fat ruins a good piece of chicken for me!
                                
                                Here&apos;s a few things I do in addition to what the recipe says.  I mentioned I cut out any fatty pieces.  I chop up some onion and add it when I throw the mushrooms in the pan.  It doesn&apos;t &apos;make or break&apos; this, but adds a nice little &apos;extra&apos; when it&apos;s sauteed.  If you buy whole mushrooms and find it too tedious/time consuming to slice them with a knife ...either buy them already sliced (usually a $1.00-$2.00 more), or buy them whole and use one of those hard boiled egg slicers ...And it keeps the slicing thickness consistent.
                                
                                Definitely try this recipe, you&apos;ll love it.  If it doesn&apos;t come out perfect the first time (and it will, but if you feel it didn&apos;t), don&apos;t be discouraged to try it again."
5,All these suggestions are very nice-if you want to splurge (on calories) and have a decadent meal. But don&apos;t miss out on the chance to try it without all the added fat. I have made this recipe many times and with a non-stick pan you can omit the butter and halve (or omit) the oil and it&apos;s still quite good. I&apos;ve also made it with and without flour and it works either way. Also with a thinner sauce you can slice up some warm French bread and use that to soak up the extra sauce on your plate-yummy and you don&apos;t even need butter!
5,"Chicken Marsala is a family favorite. This Marsala recipe is easy and delicious. The flour gives the chicken a silky coating and thickens the sauce nicely. I made only one change- I reduced the amount of oregano a half tsp is too much in my opinion. Well done and Thank you for sharing. PS: Good quality wines (Marsala and Sherry) are vital. The previous reviewer was correct avoid ""cooking wines""; if they are not good enough to drink they are not good enough to cook with."
5,This is a wonderful classic recipe! After reading some of the reviews I followed their advice and put the seasonings and flour in a bag to coat the chicken.  I used all marsala wine for the sauce and doubled the amount of mushrooms.  I removed the chicken from the pan while making the sauce and added a little half and half to it to make it creamy - it turned out great.  I have made this three times now and have finally got around to reviewing it. This is a definite keeper!
5,This is by far the best chicken marsala recipe I have ever encountered. My husband found it here two years ago and we have made it and enjoyed it often ever since. We usually double the wines using fine (sweet) Marsala wine and a dry white Sherry which leaves us extra sauce for the angel hair pasta we serve with it. We also use mushrooms of the Portabella variety. Thank you Lisa!
5,I thought this was good but I could tell just by the ingredients that it was going to need some doctoring up. I added garlic powder italian seasoning and lots of salt and pepper to the flour mixture. I cut back on the oil and butter- about 2 heaping tablespoons each. Plus I sauteed crushed garlic in the oil and butter before adding the chicken. It turned out great. My stepdaughter loved it. I served it with angel hair pasta and broccoli. But I think I may add cream to it at the end like one reviewer suggested to make more &apos;gravy&apos;. It needed more sauce for the pasta. All in all this is great! (Edited 5/22/2010)
5,My boyfriend and I LOVED this. I made it with lots of baby portabello mushrooms and I also threw onions and garlic in with the butter and oil before I placed the chicken in. I also doubled the sauce like others. I took the chicken out when it was done cooking added corn starch and a little heavy cream to the sauce and it was just how we liked it. I served with mashed garlic red potatoes I think its our new favorite dinner!:)
3,This was good but not great. I&apos;m terrible at flattening meat and poultry so I didn&apos;t bother. I didn&apos;t add mushrooms either as my fiance hates them. The chicken was tender and flavor pretty good but I like the marsala dishes more from my favorite Italian restaurant. My fiance was neutral on this. I doubt I&apos;ll make it again.
5,"My husband is currently eating his fourth bowl of this stuff, no lie. I actually made the whole deal in my cast iron skillet--sauteed, simmered, added biscuits and stuck it in the oven. Turned out perfectly and made a neat presentation, as well."
5,"Thank you for this recipe, Pam!  I prepared it ""exactly"" as the recipe stated - the eight peoole I served it to, ranging from 4 years old to 80+ years, loved it.  They thought it was better than similar dishes they&apos;ve had at those ""country"" restauants.  I&apos;ve done reviews on very few recipes even though I have been visiting this site for years - and this one merits much praise."
4,"Thank you for this recipe, we all liked very much and I will make it again. I did adjust the recipe slightly, I did not have any parsley and used some basil instead also I added 2 cloves of garlic chopped and sauteed with the vegetables. (it is difficult to make a dish in our house without garlic ;) I also used Bisquick drop biscuits for the crust. It is great to find a new way to use the leftover rotisserie chicken, and the kids love it."
5,"I&apos;ve used this site for years and never commented, but had to say but this was the best and the easiest of all the versions I&apos;ve tried!  I always add broccoli florets, and sliced almonds as well as a tablespoon of sherry to whatever version I use and it really enhances it. Sometimes I use a puff pastry to top. I copied those ideas from a restaurant whose pot pie was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!!"
5,"This was a great comfort food.  I used refrigerated biscuit dough and halved them horizontally to be sure they baked through.  I used frozen mixed vegetables, cooked them just a little bit before adding to chicken mixture.  Used quite a bit more chicken than called for, as we like lots of meat in our casseroles/meat pies.  Turned out delicious.  Will definitely make again."
5,"Loved this recipe!  I used rotisserie chicken, frozen carrots, chicken stock instead of broth and doubled the stock/flour/half and half mixture.  For the crust I used Pillsbury pie crust. Sooooo good!!  Thanks for the recipe!"
5,"This was very good! The basic recipe is excellent, but I made a few tweaks:
                                I crumbled and saute&apos;d two sweet Italian sausages and mixed with the chicken.
                                I peeled and cubed 1/2"" pieces, two medium red potatoes. Par-cooked them in lightly salted water so they were almost tender. Added them to the vegetables just before adding the flour, which I increased to 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons.
                                I had no broth so I used chicken base and added it to 3 cups water- according to pkg. instructions.
                                I had no 1/2 and 1/2, so I used a whole can of evaporated milk.
                                This mixture filled a 9x13"" Corning-ware baking dish and I still had room for the biscuits.
                                I made my own drop biscuits:
                                Mix together:
                                2 cups flour
                                2 tsp. baking powder
                                1/4 tsp baking soda
                                1 tsp salt
                                Cut in:
                                1/4 shortening
                                Stir in:
                                1 cup buttermilk
                                Drop over chicken mixture as stated and then bake at 400 for the 20-25 minutes."
4,Very good! It took a while to cook the biscuits. Next time I will either flip the biscuits over halfway through or cook a little before I put on top. But it was a great meal. Very tasty!
5,"This is the best chicken pot pie I ever ate.
                                My husband said fix it at least twice a week.
                                It&apos;s easy and gooood"
3,I HAD TO ADJUST THE 4 CUPS OF CARROTS TO ONE AND THE 2.5 CUPS OF CELERY TO 3/4. I ALSO ADDED SOME ONIONS BECAUSE I THOUGHT 2 TBSP WASN&apos;T ENOUGH. IT TURNED OUT OK THOUGH.
4,"This was delicious! My first time using fish and oyster sauce though... I think next time I make this I might reduce the fish and oyster sauce by half, but the rest of the recipe was spot on! I used serano peppers since I can&apos;t handle super hot and it worked out well for me but was still spicy enough for my heat loving husband. I will definitely be making this agian. We loved this dish!"
5,"YUM!  Great recipe.
                                
                                Chef John does say in his video that the cooking technique he used is not the ""authentic"" method, but it gets the job done, and it&apos;s likely that most home cooks will use a variation of his video method.
                                
                                My stove is also typical for American stoves and the burners do not generate the blazing BTUs needed for authentic ""stir fry"" cooking method that creates that wonderful caramelization without overcooking lean meats like white meat chicken and most cuts of pork.
                                
                                To get a better caramelization without overcooking/drying the meat I use the Chinese meat ""velveting"" technique, and cook the meat separately from the veggies, or rice when doing a fried rice.
                                
                                Velveting is very simple.  Once you&apos;ve cut the meat into small cubes, slices, or chopped, then put the meat in a non plastic bowl and a bit of white wine, soy, and the very important corn starch, mix to coat and let it sit for about 15-20 minutes.  The liquids will high salinity will seep into the meat bringing a bit more moisture into it, and the corn starch will create a coating that tempers the high heat of the pan so that the meat cooks nicely yet retains its moistness.  It is a WONDERFUL technique that works.
                                
                                Once everything is prepped, heat up your pan with some oil in it.  Don&apos;t use EVOO as it has a low smoking point and will burn too quickly with the high heat you need.  Plus, EVOO has a particular flavor that is better suited to salad dressings and low heat saute dishes.
                                
                                Once the oil starts to sm"
5,"This is a great recipe! It was better than the expensive take out that I get. I doubled the sauce because I wanted to add some vegetables. I seared mushrooms in a cast iron skillet (hint: put in microwave for 30 sec and it will release water that doesn&apos;t allow them to brown) also added some bok choy.  Yummy, wish I had left overs. It was a little salty but I think I may have added a bit too much fish sauce. First time using oyster sauce and I love it. Thai basil is a great addition to the recipe. You can get it at your local Asian market.  Thank you, Chef."
5,"Wow, it was FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe to a Tee and wouldn&apos;t change a thing. As for the variables, I used chicken breast instead of thighs, a Serrano Pepper (with all seeds) and one little habanero pepper (used 4 seeds), 2 tsp palm sugar, and regular basil. I enjoy a medium spice for the most part at restaurants and the pepper ratio I used worked really well, very spicy but the flavorful kind. It will get you sniffling for sure! Tone down the spice by removing some seeds. I made it last week, and I am making it again this week! A new dinner staple! Thanks Chef John!"
5,"This is sooooo good!   I made this to serve as lettuce wraps with some jasmine rice and veggie egg rolls.  It was savory, sweet, spicy and delicious.  Next time I will serve it with rice and a sunny side egg as suggested...but the lettuce wraps were an excellent alternative.   
                                
                                Tip: Double or triple the recipe as the leftovers make a quick and delicious lunch for work!"
5,"Fantastic! The hardest part was chopping up the chicken without a butcher knife. Might have to invest one because this was a hit in my house (also, it looks like fun...and a great de-stressor :) ). Flavor was amazing! I had about 1-1/2 pounds of chicken and I doubled the sauce because we like enough sauce for the rice so soak up some. I served over jasmine rice. Everyone loved it and not a bite left over!"
5,"This is absolutely delicious!! My husband would eat Thai food EVERY day if he could.  I&apos;ve always been so intimidated to try cooking Thai cuisine, but, Chef John made this so easy.  I love, love, love Chef John&apos;s recipes & his videos are immensely helpful and priceless!  Definitely chop chicken when it&apos;s still partially frozen!  I backed off on the fish sauce a bit b/c it just smells so unappetizing and the 1st time I made this I felt like it was all I could taste...only used 1 tsp. of fish sauce and it&apos;s perfect for us.  Also, Chef John loooooves spice in his food.  While I love spice, too, the rest of my fam isn&apos;t crazy about it, so, use peppers at your own discretion.  I think I use 1 (sometimes only 1/2) serrano pepper, seeded.  This barely makes enough for  3-4.  If making for a bigger crowd then I would double.  Also, make sure you have all of your ingredients prepped & ready since this cooks up FAST.  In his video he actually cooks this in what looks like a cast iron skillet, but, I actually cook it in my wok.  Have made this several times & comes out perfect every time!--thanks, Chef John!!"
2,"What did I do wrong?! I followed the recipe word for word, made absolutely no substitutes, and the juices from the chicken totally took over the dish and ruined it. The oyster-fish sauce never thickened or caramelized leaving the chicken extremely bland."
5,"I read the reviews before making and so doubled the sauce as that seemed to be a common thing. I used 3 chilli peppers and found it was only a hint of spice, nothing over powering. Would definitely make again, with additional Thai peppers and possibly bell peppers for colour.
                                Edit: 3-4 chilli peppers seems to be right for us (5 was a bit too much, although can handle). Half an orange bell pepper added nice colour to the dish. Take the time to cut up the chicken into smaller than bite sized pieces."
5,"I made the marinade for the chicken according to recipe.  Instead of the vegetables called for, I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables because that is what I had on hand.  I cooked it as directed.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was very flavorful.  We loved it and this will be my new chicken stir-fry recipe.  Thank you."
5,Really great recipe! I added snap peas because I love them. I also added some hot oil to give it a little more kick. (We like spicy stuff!) Will make this again.
3,this was decent.  I liked it but it needed a little more asian flavor to it for my liking.  It was not bad though!
4,"I doubled this recipe because I wanted to have it for the entire week. Here are the changes I made:
                                Any recipe with soy sauce you must taste before you incorporate the rest of your ingredients. Having cooked w/ soy sauce before I knew 2/3c would be too much for me but maybe it works for others. Even in doubling the recipe, I only used ""1/4"" c of low sodium soy sauce. (Keep in mind, if you use terriyaki sauce, it has soy sauce in it so don&apos;t use both!).  Sesame seed oil is what gives most oriental dishes it&apos;s flavor but used sparingly.  A little goes a long way and it has a strong flavor. Brown your chicken first in the oil and then marinate it.  You will still get all the flavor when you pour the marinade you made in the pot w/ the veggies & chicken. For my marinade, I used 1/2c brown sugar, 1/4c soy sauce, 1/2c sweet & sour sauce, 1/4 rice wine vinegar, tbsp ginger, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 1/4c green onions, 3 tbsp red pepper flakes. Take browned chicken & put in a ziplock & pour the marinade over it. Place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. I used thawed frozen veggies & only sautéed them in the sesame oil 3-5 min so they wouldn&apos;t get soggy during the cooking time w/ the chicken. I also used brown rice and all came out great!"
5,"I think you need to highlight to people not used to cooking with soy sauce, that they need to use a Dark Chinese Soy which is a lot less saltier than a Japanese soy or a light soy sauce :)"
1,We couldn&apos;t eat this dish.  Total salt overload due to the amount of soy sauce this recipe calls for.  Be cautious!  I thought it was odd that I used 3/4 of my new bottle of soy sauce.  Chefs beware.....unless you absolutely love lots of salt!
5,"This deserves 5 stars.  The sauce mixture is salty, spicy and sweet, exactly what I was hoping for. For those of you complaining about the level of saltiness - marinate the chicken in a portion of the liquid, just enough to cover it.  Reserve the remainder of the sauce and add at the end, a little bit by little bit, tasting as you go.  I don&apos;t understand why people blame the recipe for being overpoweringly salty, at the end of the day, you&apos;re the one cooking!  Any good chef knows they must taste as they go.  Wasn&apos;t too salty at all for us."
4,"This was good. But I made a few mods to suit my personal taste and local availability,
                                
                                 For veggies I used mushrooms, broccoli, red peppers and added some sweetcorn kernels at the very end. It made a very colourful (red, green, yellow) dish.
                                
                                Also used a grated chilli rather than garlic in the marinade, and served with noodles not rice
                                
                                I found that (since I like my vegetable reasonably crispy) I did not need the last 5-7 minutes cooking. Just stir fried the chicken in step 4, then added the veggies back for 30 secs to heat through."
5,"This was great, but I changed everything about it.  Instead of chicken, I used ribeye steaks.  I swapped out the soy sauce for A-1 steak sauce.  And instead of the veggies, I made baked potatoes.  Come to think of it, it turned out to be steak and baked potatoes.  But it was delicious, 5 stars!!  Just kidding, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was excellent, thank you!"
5,"Although I made some changes, I am rating this more for myself.  I used miracle whip, personal preference.  Also mixed in some garlic powder, pepper and dried basil.  I then rolled the chicken pieces in the parmesan cheese.  I left out the bread crumbs altogether.  I had sliced the chicken breast into 4 pieces to have more coating so the cooking time was good for me.  Very nice flavor, quick and easy.  A keeper."
4,This was so much better than expected. I am nervous about serving rare/raw chicken so I cooked for 45 min at 350 degrees (accurate for my oven at least) and my husband loved it. Loved it! I was a little weary about using mayonnaise but the finished product really was delicious. I added some salt & pepper and served with peas & carrots and a dinner roll. Delicious! Makes a great balanced meal and can be calorie controlled for those who wish.
3,"I’m generally very impressed with Hellmann’s recipes, but this time not so much.  So I changed it up big time I guess.  I salted and peppered the chicken breasts, then spread them with mayonnaise to which I added fresh minced garlic.   I mixed panko bread crumbs and the grated Parmesan in a ratio of 2:1, and added fresh oregano, parsley and rosemary, topping each of the chicken breasts as the recipe directs.  I gave them a drizzle of  olive oil before popping them in the oven.  I much preferred that method and those fresh ingredients rather than mixing the cheese in with the mayonnaise and using Italian seasoned bread crumbs which I don’t think I would have cared for.  I sliced the chicken and served it over “Spinach Ranch Salad,” also from this site, and “Broccoli Cheese Soup V.”"
4,"This is such a great recipe! My Mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid. I usually go an egg wash, but I thought I&apos;d give the mayo a try just for old times sake and to see what my husband thought. I used more bread crumbs and added more seasoning to to them (parsley, oregano, basil, rosemary). I also opted to use Hellman&apos;s light mayo and light Parmesan cheese. I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick and these came out moist and delicious - perfect with a side of twice baked potates and a salad."
5,Tastey recipe. I used exact ingredients in recipe) but prepared a little differently because of lack of time. I rolled chicken in mayo and dipped them in mixture of parmesan and bread crumbs. I then cooked it on a george foreman grill. I&apos;ve never tried anything breaded on my GF grill but it turned out perfectly and took less than 10 minutes cook time! By the way I used PANKO Italian seasoned bread crumbs which have a much better texture than regular bread crumbs.
5,"Omg! This was to die for! I always read the other reviews and many times revise the recipe based on the other ones, but I didn&apos;t change much on this one. I added some spices (oregano, parsley, garlic, salt & pepper) my husband loved it, I loved it too, and I&apos;m not a big fan of meat, but this really was amazing! It&apos;s a keeper!"
5,"Wonderful! I added more seasonings to the Mayo mix: seasoning salt, garlic powder, dash of cayenne and some lemon pepper.. coated chicken in mayo mix, and tossed them in a ziplock with bread crumbs. Sprinkle some paprika on top for a fancier look.. baked on rack over cookie sheet so the bottoms didn&apos;t get soggy- there are none for leftovers! will be making this again."
5,"This was delicious. I put the chicken and mayo mixture in a bag and coated, then put the coated chicken into another bag with the bread crumbs (I used more than it called for, for a thicker crust) so the chicken was evenly coated, not just on the top.
                                My husband (who hates mayo) loved it, didn&apos;t even know it had mayonnaise ;)"
5,I added parsley oregano and garlic powder to the cheese/mayo mix. I cut the chicken in half then salt and peppered the chicken. I rolled the chicken in the cheese/mayo mix then coated in Italian bread crumbs. For thick breasts it took about 30 minutes at 425. Perfection!
5,"This is my recipe so I just wanted to offer a few more helpful tips! Tip #1: Feel free to add more herbs and spices to taste-- I often up the rosemary and add in dried thyme or oregano, Tip #2: To get an extra crispy skin switch the oven to broil on high heat for the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, and Tip #3: This chicken also tastes great the next day so feel free to make extra for sandwiches, soups, tacos, or chicken pot pie."
5,"We have a meal like this basically once every ten days using Trader Joe&apos;s kosher chicken.  The difference with this one was the garlic and the herbs since I usually just use salt and pepper along with my lemon olive oil.  This was very nice, and I&apos;ll change to this more savory style now.  Very good!  We loved it!  Thanks!"
5,Tried this and loved it.  Easy to prepare.  I didn&apos;t have rosemary but added a Mrs. Dash alternative.  I did broil it during the last 15 minutes and it came out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Great tasting and it seems healthy.  Will definitely make it again.
5,This was  a very good receipe. The person that broiled the chicken must not be able to follow directions. The recipe states to bake the chicken not broil it.
5,"I drizzle on the olive oil, add herbs (basil, oregano, thyme) plus onion powder, salt and pepper, top with minced garlic and a sprig of fresh rosemary on each piece.  I don&apos;t refrigerate them for 45 as the recipe suggests; I just put them straight in the oven, and it always turns out delicious!  We love this recipe!"
5,"This is a 5 star recipe.  I don&apos;t know why (us271934) felt she had to instruct us on the thickness/size and the various lengths of time it takes to bake a thicker cut of meat or chicken breast, in this case.  Everyone who bakes/cooks knows the bigger/thicker the piece of meat, the longer you have to bake it.  My family found this delicious and refreshing.  Kind of like cooking out...know your grill or oven!"
3,There is nothing wrong with this recipe at all with the exception of how to account for the wide variation of breast thickness/weight a consumer may receive from their grocery. The broiler is a radiant heat source so the amount of time it takes to penetrate a material is very dependent on thickness. The thawed split breasts I used were obviously thicker than the author&apos;s and after the ~20 minutes in the broiler the internal temp was only 124 degrees. A continuation of broiling would leave the exterior burnt. It would seem that broiler recipes have an built in requirement for some consideration for thickness and weight. As a suggestion it might be handy for the original recipe to indicate what the thickness and weight was so those reading it could try to adjust.
5,"The aroma that filled the kitchen as these were baking was a mouth-watering prelude of what was to come.  These were incredibly flavorful and so juicy and tender you&apos;d think they  had been brined.  Rather than individual seasonings I used my favorite Tuscan seasoning blend, but I don&apos;t think you could go wrong seasoning these any way you like.  As I&apos;ve found (unfortunately) so often is the case, chickens are bred to be much  bigger than they used to be, and that means larger breast portions too.  That said, even tho&apos; the breasts I used were huge,  I found 40-45 minutes in the oven was just right, so watch cooking time carefully!  We sliced these up and drizzled the pan juices over them upon serving.  I served this with Golden Potato and Herb Bake, also from this site, and fresh steamed broccoli.  It was a beautiful, light, and satisfying dinner."
4,"I also made cuts into the chicken and stuffed them with garlic cloves and fresh basil leaves but you could stuff it with garlic alone and/or any fresh spices that you like.  This gave flavour throughout the chicken, not just the top section, especially if you are using thicker cuts of chicken."
5,"I did add one large onion and a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce. This was a little thick, I did add a little canned milk to thin it out just a touch. Very rich, very good. NO LEFTOVERS. This reminds me of something similar Mom made for me when I was growing up."
3,"I&apos;ve seen many recipes for ""ground beef"" stroganoff over the years but this is the first time I&apos;ve made one. The one thing that I didn&apos;t like was that the sour cream totally liquified once combined with the meat. The dish had zero eye appeal because of the watery texture. The Greek seasoning was a nice addition but overall this stroganoff was a disappointment. In all fairness it could be that I wouldn&apos;t like any ground beef stroganoff so moving forward I&apos;ll stick with the real deal version. Sorry olderguy for the less than favorable review."
5,"Loved this!! I didn&apos;t have enough sour cream, so I substituted some half and half to make up for it. It gave it a nice, creamy texture and the sauce to go over the noodles. I added 1/2 a teaspoon more seasoning than the recipe called for as my family likes a lot of spice. I didn&apos;t have any brand name Greek seasoning blend so I used one I made from here: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231228/greek-seasoning-blend/ 
                                It turned out great too!!"
5,"Great recipe. I added a bit of garlic, a couple tablespoons of milk, slow simmered, and added the onions close to the end because I like my onions on the crunchy side for a bit more texture. Thanks for sharing! We loved it."
3,Average flavour profile but a good quick and easy meal. I actually added a teaspoon of McCormick Mild Curry Spice. It gave it a wonderful savory depth. Nice crisp peppers and steamed green beans complimented the dish nicely.
4,I made this without the noodles so basically just the beef... also added sauteed eggplant. It&apos;s a simple recipe but delicious and easy to make with little ingredients. I changed a bit but the idea was the same and I appreciate the inspiration. Thanks for sharing!
5,I liked it and easy to do for a quick supper
4,Love that Richard shared making this dinner for 6 kids. I have a large family to feed and this recipe saved time! Thank you.
5,"I pretty much followed the recipe, except I cooked it for eight hours in a crockpot. I browned the onion before putting it in. I added a few sliced carrots and a bay leaf. At the end, it was a bit too runny, so I added some instant potato flakes to thicken it. So, I didn&apos;t follow the recipe exactly, but pretty darned close. Very tasty soup that I will make again!"
5,"I made it to the recipe, but rather than over rice I made it as an appetizer and served it on lettuce leaves as a wrap. Our guests loved it. I would make it again and serve it the same way."
5,"I wrapped mine in flour tortillas and added shredded cabbage and made “tacos”. It was so good, and I garnished it with the red garlic chili sauce that I get at the Asian supermarket. I even forgot the rice, but it didn’t even matter. Quick, easy, and delicious!"
5,"Your busy weeknight needs this dish. Even your lazy Saturdays will be happy with it. My family devoured this. It’s so simple to make and it is super delicious and full of flavor. Leftovers warm easily, which is great when you’ve got teenage midnight grazers. 
                                The first time I made it, I served it over rice. Second time with rice noodles. The next time I make it I’ll take the advice of the other reviewer and serve as tacos with cabbage. Thank you for the awesome recipe."
5,"Great, quick recipe that the whole family loved. I would probably cut some of the brown sugar next time and DEFINITELY use low salt soy sauce. I didn&apos;t have enough so I used some regular and it was pretty salty. Next time I&apos;m going to try with coconut aminos. I also added some shredded carrots at the end to increase veggie content. Served with steamed rice. This one will go into our rotation!"
5,This  is so delicious.    I added cauliflower to the meat mixture Since I needed to use it up.  I’ll make this again.  Excellent flavor.
5,Absolutely delicious!  Made rice in my rice maker while getting everything else ready.  Will add one or a combination of: cashews.  broccoli.  water chestnuts.  carrots.  possibilities are endless!
5,I had also most every ingredient (I was missing green onions) but it was still very delicious I can’t wait to make this again and I’ll make sure I have green onions. This is now added to my family’s favorite meals to cook.
5,"I didn&apos;t have sesame oil, so I just used canola oil.  I also didn&apos;t have crushed red pepper so I sprinkles in some hot chili powder.  I substituted the rice for quinoa for the kids and cauliflower rice for adults.  This is a new family favorite!"
5,"This was really good and flavorful. I don’t like to change peoples recipes but I needed to use up a red bell pepper, shallot and broccoli so I added them in. Yuuummmm??. Will definitely make this again. 
                                Thank you"
1,it was very good
4,Almost exactly the same way I cook Picadillo! Only I used white wine and did not have capers. Delicious. My entire family loves Picadillo.
5,"I learned of this recipe and Cuban food by reading one of the submitter&apos;s blogs. I was very excited to try this recipe and I was not let down. Although I&apos;ve had nothing like it before (not a huge Cuban influence where I live) and nothing to compare it to I can&apos;t imagine this ""Picadillo"" any other way. What a tasty dish! I thought the red wine would over power but it really only added to the flavours. The browned potatoes added something too. Next time I may get them a little crispier for some more texture. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of omitting the raisins. I just can&apos;t bring myself to eat them. I imagine they would&apos;ve added a sweetness that we obviously didn&apos;t miss. Thanks lutzflcat for sharing a cultural dish that we would have never known about. It&apos;s a keeper!"
5,"I&apos;m the submitter of this recipe, and one change I&apos;ve made since submitting this recipe is that I slice the olives instead of chopping.  Makes for nicer presentation and you get more olive flavor from the slices."
5,"This is what we (two of us with some taste-testing from my visiting daughter) had for dinner half the recipe that is and we agreed that it is a keeper! I do think I would do things just a tad different next time. First I won&apos;t forget to buy the green pepper! I made no sub for that. Second I would add double the cumin (personal preference). Third I used regular-sized green olives and cut them in half but next time I&apos;d either quarter them or slice them in neat little slices (I&apos;d like more of a bite of them more often). Fourth I&apos;d cut the potatoes a little smaller---about 3/8"" to 1/2"" cubes and maybe even add just a little tiny bit of butter to the olive oil to make them brown a little better. I loved it when I had a raisin in my fork--just that little bit of sweetness was great! We do have a few leftovers but we are going to wrap those in flour tortillas with a little cheese and salsa this weekend! I&apos;ll let you know how that turns out! Thanks for this new taste treat!"
4,I made this tonight with Congri (Cuban black beans and rice) and it was a winner! I&apos;m half Puerto Rican but never cook the food I grew up eating it always seemed so time consuming to make. This is actually a pretty easy dish to make and reminds me of the filling my mother makes for empanadillas particularly the olives capers and raisins. Like another reviewer I took a shortcut i cubed the potatoes and microwaved them while browning the meat. I thought I had raisins but couldn&apos;t find them so I resorted to picking them out of a bag of trail mix! I didn&apos;t have the amount the recipe called for but that was ok because that&apos;s the one thing I don&apos;t care for in the empanadilla filling. My boyfriend was hesitant initially - he wasn&apos;t sure what to make of the picadillo but a few bites in and he was hooked. Instead of plain white rice I recommend making congri which is pretty easy and flavorful and can be made alongside this dish (especially if you use a recipe that calls for canned black beans - I used one that was not from allrecipes).
4,I halved the recipe to use 3/4 pound of ground beef. I nuked the potato to save dirtying a pan used white wine instead of red and doubled up on the olives (we like our olives). Never having eaten picadillo before I wasn&apos;t sure what to expect. After it simmered for a bit I ended up doubling the cumin and oregano and will probably double the potato next time as well. (I liked the idea of frying the potatoes before adding so they wouldn&apos;t get mushy) A tasty dish definitely different from our usual. Thanks lutzflcat I will make this again.
5,Made this tonight turns out just for myself. I used a meatloaf mix. That is what I had. Didn&apos;t have any golden raisins therefore omitted. I really liked it. I imagine the raisins would counter act the richness of the wine and meat. If I do make again I will have to plan better. Thanks for the post lutzcat
5,"This ""Cuban-Style Picadillo"" was excellent! I loved the way the sweetness of the wine permeated even the capers and olives. This meal is a real treat! I can hardly wait to make it again! My only change next time will be to fry the cumin with the ground beef and onion mixture as I usually do (instead of adding the cumin in with the liquids as in this recipe) to take the ""raw edge"" off my freshly-ground spice. Thank you lutzflcat for sharing your recipe!"
5,Really yummy...followed recipe closely but used white cooking wine and black raisins because I had it. Served with white rice!
3,The capers are overpowering.
4,I think this is a goo basic but I needed to add rice to round it out!
5,I baked the peppers for 45 minutes in a 400 degree oven instead of  a pressure cooker. Then topped with Colby Jack cheese and diced tomatoes.
5,"I have to say WOW, because this recipe was simple and delicious! I thought I&apos;d choose this as my first ever instant pot meal and I&apos;m so glad I did. I feel a lot more comfortable using it after this. Since I had a mini I have to do two &apos;batches&apos; to cook all four peppers, but I still used the same amount of water and cooking time and the peppers turned out tender and delicious. I also used colored bell peppers because I love things sweet and savory, and I find them a bit more sweet.
                                
                                Thank you so much for making this recipe!"
5,Easy and delicious. I added shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream to each after plating.
5,"I have made this several times and I always enjoy this simple but delicious recipe. The only thing I do differently is add a little salt and pepper to the meat, and I use ground turkey over beef."
4,add salt & pepper
3,I found it difficult getting the peppers out of the instant pot and plated. They fell apart so I am thinking this may be a better oven recipe.
3,Needs more spice IMHO. I added some paprika and garlic. Also 3 minutes is more than enough to cook the peppers.
4,I never thought I would make stuffed peppers they just seemed liked something I would not enjoy then one day my niece served me a stuffed pepper and it was wonderful so I set out to make a stuffed pepper for myself and came across this recipe. I don&apos;t own an Instant Pot so like one reviewer I baked it in a 400 degree oven for 45 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly as written but like other reviewers have stated it does need some salt and pepper added to the meat mixture. If I could I would give it four and a half stars but I can&apos;t so I&apos;m giving it four stars due to the lack of salt and pepper in the ingredients list. I will make these again. Yum!!!
1,1.25 oz of taco seasoning is way too much. Stuffing very heavy being virtually all meat.
4,"Not outstanding, not extraordinary, but good and satisfying.  Flavor is good – I used fresh thyme (the equivalent in fresh is three times that of dried) and added some celery just because I generally do. I didn’t bother cooking the vegetables first just because I generally don’t.  There is minimal filler and I appreciated that.  I like the brown, crusty exterior on meatloaf so I shaped this as one loaf on a cookie sheet and baked it for 1-1/2 hours.  I did not use the brown sugar glaze as the sugar did not appeal to me so I served this with a simple brown mushroom gravy.  As this recipe’s first reviewer I’m happy to report that while there is much wiggle-room with this recipe to make it “your own,” this basic, old-fashioned meatloaf is good  just as it stands."
5,The brown sugar glaze is what takes this recipe from good and satisfying to outstanding and extraordinary! Please give it a try next time naples34102. Thank you for your review.
5,"As a veteran meatloaf chef, this is a terrific recipe. I actually added more brown sugar to the sauce and added winch (Worcestershire) sauce plus sweet chili sauce. I never use loaf pans when I make meatloaf. Instead, I shape the meatloaf recipe on top of a foil lined jelly roll sheet. A 3 pound meatloaf with recipe ingredients approximates: 2"" high x 5"" wide x 10"" long. Pour the sauce/glaze on top of this Bigfoot meatloaf, roll up the sides of the foil a bit to hold in the sauce and pop it into your oven. Thank you for this great recipe, Leigh Ann. We thoroughly enjoyed it here in Texas!!"
5,I don&apos;t care what anyone says this is an outstanding meatloaf!! The only things I did different was I used an equal amount of panko bread crumbs in place of the oatmeal and made a brown gravy instead of the ketchup based glaze. I&apos;m just not a fan of ketchup. This was simply the best meatloaf I&apos;ve ever made. I can finally stop looking for a recipe for this I&apos;m sticking with this. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!!!
5,I saw a recipe from Tennessee so I knew I had to try it. My Dad took our family to Tennessee and Kentucky from Wisconsin to visit relatives one summer and I remember the food there was amazing! Anyway I was not disappointed and I do believe this is the best meatloaf I&apos;ve ever had- even better than my mother&apos;s which I love. I agree with Leigh Ann- not putting the top coating on is like painting the Mona Lisa without a smile. Thanks Leigh Ann- my wife and I are extremely impressed and I&apos;m already making another batch.:)
4,i cut this recipe in half as i only had a little over 1# of ground beef. this was very good. different from what i would normally make. i forgot to add the milk (oops). nice firm texture. i really minced the heck out of the yellow bell pepper i had on hand so that my DS would not see it....i also roasted my vidalia onion a bit and also cut that up pretty finely. thanks for the post Leigh Ann:-)
5,"very smooth excel. texture, suggestion in the glaze try 1oz tenn/kentucky whiskey mixed in."
5,"I made this pretty much exactly how the recipe says except I chose to sauté the onion and green pepper as opposed to microwaving them. My husband raved it was the best meatloaf he had ever had so I will definitely be adding this recipe to the ""keepers"". Also as many other people have mentioned the glaze really seals it on this recipe. SO good."
5,In a Word excellent-
1,I did not care for this recipe.
4,"Simple and satisfying comfort food.  Great gravy.   I prepared this as the recipe directed with a couple of exceptions – I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the onions and mushrooms and used all beef broth, no water.  I don’t understand why the submitter instructs that you essentially dilute the gravy with water.  Use the 30 minute cooking time only as a guide – mine didn’t take nearly that long!"
5,"Tonight was second time I have made this. I love love love it!!!!! I did not change anything either time other than using 1.5-2 pds of meat (for a total of 8-9 patties) and doubling all the ingredients for enough gravy for the 8-9 patties. I always struggle with what sides go with what so I will do what I wish others would do and tell you I made Parmesan Roasted Potatoes, Brussel sprouts, and French bread with it. Yum yum!"
5,"I&apos;ve made this recipe a few times with no changes.  It turns out fantastic, the perfect comfort food especially when served with mashed potatoes and corn. Yum!  Thank you for the great recipe!!"
5,"I&apos;m sure this recipe is great as tendered. I made a couple changes , I omitted fresh mushrooms and flour and substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup I used the whole 14.5 ounce can of beef stock . I also added a clove or two of chopped garlic to the meat.  overall it quickly became one of my favorite things to cook"
5,"This is a great recipe. Like many others, I tweaked it a little as well: I used a ""beefy onion soup"" mix instead of regular onion soup mix. Also, I use golden mushroom soup in my recipes that call for gravy; I sauteed the mushrooms and onions as directed, then added that to the beef broth and soup mix, stirred in the golden mushroom soup, and voila - a really good, rich gravy (the flour is unnecessary). I&apos;ve prepared this dish three times now and there are usually leftovers, but only if I make extra (it&apos;s that good!)"
4,This pattys were great but the broth was not. You have to adjust the broth to your taste. The gravy was bland so I added more Worcestershire (to taste or 1 table spoon) minced garlic (to taste 1 teaspoon) pepper and sea salt. I did not use water but added 2 1/2 cups of low sodium beef broth instead. I served this with steam broccoli and twice baked potatoes.
3,Because I have growing teen boys I doubled this recipe. It wasn&apos;t great it was just ok. I was hoping for more depth of flavor. After browning it sure didn&apos;t take 30 minutes to cook thru more like 10. I&apos;m going to continue searching for other Salisbury steak recipes.
5,"This recipe is excellent!!!  My husband doesn&apos;t care for mushrooms, so I omitted them. I used 1 large Vidalia onion and swanson&apos;s beef broth for the stock. The patties were tender and full of flavor, and the gravy was awesome. Best Salisbury steak My husband and I have ever had. Thanks for a great recipe. I&apos;ll be making this again and again for sure."
4,"I just made Salisbury steak and this recipe is very similar to mine. The only difference is that I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, water instead of milk and freshly ground pepper. I also added a couple of tablespoons of ketchup. I rarely measure things when I cook and I had more than a pound of meat, but I probably used more Worcestershire sauce than what is called for here because of the addition of ketchup. For the gravy, I removed the patties to a plate after I browned them and used the same skillet that I browned the patties in, to brown the mushrooms and onions as I did not want to waste the yummy brown bits that add so much flavor to the gravy. I did not use the onion soup/water, I just used low sodium beef broth. I put the patties and gravy in a covered casserole dish and I finished mine in the oven. I had it at 350 degrees for about a half hour. Cooking times are going to vary depending on the size/thickness of your patties, the type of pan and the way your stove works, so I cannot rate any recipe according to whether or not it was done in the time stated, there are way too many variables. We&apos;re having the leftovers tonight!"
3,These were ok. They weren t particularly tender. Everyone thought they were quite bland too. Next time I ll use half the meat for the same amount of other ingredients.
4,I went ahead and made half this as meatballs and half as hamburgers. I made several larger meatballs. They will brown really fast so keep an eye. Can&apos;t go wrong adding more ingredients to the meats flavoring.
4,"10.23.18 I followed this recipe to the letter, and there’s one thing that I will change. There’s a lot of fat that cooks out of the ground beef that IMO needs to be drained.  The recipe doesn’t tell you to do that, but I usually do, but didn’t today. If you brown the fresh tomatoes with the meat, if you drain it, you’re losing all of that sweet juice from the tomatoes. And although the final product was very good, it was greasy. So in the future, I will brown the meat, drain the fat, and then add tomatoes along with the remaining ingredients to simmer. On the positive side, this had very different flavors which we thoroughly enjoyed, and I definitely will make it again."
4,"The general methodology is an authentic one, although most would likely use garlic and ginger instead of the curry powder. The process of cooking onion first and then the rest of spices with the meat, until it has a cooked smell and the oil separates from the meat mixture, is important and has a name ( bhoonna). This can take 10-15 minutes during which the pot has to be stirred intermittently. Oil should be removed after this process to allow for proper fragrance and flavor of the dish. Because the oil separates, the spices are not lost."
5,This recipe was amazing and a quick meal for the family. I used one can of diced tomatoes since I didn’t have fresh ones and I used frozen peas instead of canned peas because I don’t like the texture of canned peas. I will definitely make this again.
4,"Pretty tasty for an easy weeknight meal. I substituted shredded carrots for the peas, cooked them with the onion at the start. Added 1 cup of water at the end to make it more saucy. I would say the amount of seasonings are spot on. We ate it with Basmati and cauliflower Rice to cut back on the carbs."
4,"The recipe was an easy make and although I am not use to using curry, I must say the flavor is vibrant and strong. The prepared dish was a very good quick and easy meal. I will be making it more often in the future."
5,I used Gardein crumbles instead of beef and it worked well! I added a little water to make sure it didn&apos;t dry out too much. The spice mixture really makes the dish special. The peas ad a touch of sweetness to the final dish.
4,"This was quite good. I used canned diced tomatoes and frozen peas. I didn&apos;t think it had enough sauce so added some water. It was still fairly dry. The moisture was quickly absorbed by the rice. I think it would benefit from the addition of yogurt or sour cream. All in all, it had a nice curry flavor and a fair amount of spice. Will likely make it again."
5,"Next time I&apos;ll use a can of diced tomatoes and avoid the skins. I drained the grease (of course, duh) and seasoned to taste - so, more curry and salt. I used frozen peas, but measured them in a Purex measuring cup and filled it with water so the curry wouldn&apos;t be too dry. I LOVE curry and  this dish was different than anything I&apos;ve tried before and I&apos;ll make it again. I might try it over egg noddles next time because there&apos;s a pandemic and I can&apos;t find more rice."
5,My family loves this recipe. Make sure to use the correct curry powder though. The yellow turmeric curry in the spice section. Not the curry from the Asian isle/store.
1,The cook times are glaringly inaccurate and the finished product just tastes like fat and peas. Yuck! Needs way more spice.
5,This recipe was excellent.  I have made it twice already.  I added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture and sauteed the onions in a little butter and garlic just for a few minutes until the onions were softened. It was delicious!!!!! thanks
4,Good Stuff - I did follow the advice of other reviewers:  1.  Sauted the onion 2.  Use seasoned bread crumbs 3.  Doubled the ketchup mixture and reduced the amount of mustard a tad 4.  1 tbsp Worstishire in the meat mix 5.  Line the pan with foil for easy clean up 6.  LET THE MEAT REST before slicing.  Served it with Paula Deens Cottage Potato&apos;s and steamed vegetables. No complaints from the boys who were over for dinner.   Went down well with a 2004 Pinot Noir. Will make this again.
5,"This was a great recipe.  I compiled and followed all of the advice of previous reviewers: 
                                 
                                -I lightly browned the onions in butter before adding.  
                                -I also added chopped green onions, mushrooms, and a green bell pepper. 
                                -I used italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  
                                -I tripled the sauce (many said that there was not enough sauce/topping) and 
                                -I baked for longer than the recipe states (I baked for a total of one hour and 25 minutes).  
                                
                                It came out perfectly.  Thanks for the great recipe, and reviewers thanks for the great hints/amendments!"
5,"I have tried some more ""exotic"" meatloaf recipes on this site which have turned out quite good, but my husband wanted more of a basic meatloaf so that it would be good on a sandwich the next day.  I chose this recipe based on the high marks and the easy ingredients.  I substituted ground turkey for the beef, and followed the ""most helpful"" suggestions of sauteeing the onions in butter + garlic, and adding 1 Tbsp. of worchestshire to the meat mix.  Other than that, followed the recipe completely, and it was wonderful!!!  Very tasty and moist (one thing I can&apos;t stand is a dry meatloaf, not this one!) and I have a feeling it will make great meatloaf sandwiches tomorrow.  Thanks for the post!"
5,I made this recipe and altered it according to previous reviews:  1) I added Worcestershire Sauce 2)didn&apos;t have any fresh onion so I used minced 3)added garlic powder 4) added 1 slice of bread ripped into pieces since it seemed too wet when mixing 5)used a glass baking dish 6)doubled the topping 7)used seasoned bread crumbs.  A 1.30# of meat cooked in an hour.  This turned out great and we went back for seconds even when my man is sick and said he wasn&apos;t hungry!  I personally thought the topping was a tad too sweet so I would do everything the same next time except reduce the brown sugar some.  This was very easy and a big hit.  Will definitely make again and again!!!
5,"YUMMY!!! Made this dish for company the other night and WOW! It was a BIG hit! My 6 yr old had 2 huge pieces and my hubby even had leftovers for breakfast the next morning while we were all still sleeping! I used 2-1/4lbs. of ground beef, kept the 1 onion(1 of my guests is not a big onion fan), 2 eggs, 1-1/2 cups of both milk and SEASONED breadcrumbs, threw in some garlic powder and parsley flakes and doubled the ketchup mixture. Seasoned breadcrumbs are a must for this recipe; Would be very bland without them. Thanks for the great recipe! :)"
5,"Hands down, this was the best meatloaf that I&apos;ve ever made.  I used about 2.3 lbs. of ground beef.  
                                
                                Following some of the advice of others as well as adding a few of my own tweaks, the meatloaf was perfect.  
                                
                                Here&apos;s what I did:
                                
                                1.  I sautéed finely chopped onion, 3 cloves (minced garlic) & 2 stalks of celery in butter (which really makes the loaf tender); then added it to the ground beef.
                                
                                2.  I added 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to the ground beef mixture along with 2 eggs instead of 1, 1 1/4 cup of milk & about 1 1/2 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs.
                                
                                3.  For the sauce:  I initially made it as the directions indicated with 2 TBSP. of brown sugar, and found it to be way too sweet.  I then added 1/3 more ketchup and a couple of dashes of Worcestershire Sauce and it was perfect.
                                
                                4.  It was an abundance of sauce, and a lot of the other reviews said that there wasn&apos;t enough sauce, so I spooned a thin layer at the bottom of the loaf, molded half the loaf, then sauced the top, and then added the rest of the loaf on top and sauced it really well.  This was absolutely perfect.  
                                
                                5.  Lastly, there was no specification on whether or not to cook the meatloaf covered or uncovered.  I used enough aluminum foil to line the baking dish as well as cover the top (so I essentially wrapped the loaf in foil) and cooked covered for 45 minutes, drained most of any accumulated liquid and cooked uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.
                                
                                This was super moist and delicious!!!!!"
5,"I made this meatloaf with my boyfriend. Not only was it delicious but we had a lot of fun making it. At first i was worried that it would be too onion-y, but using the whole onion was well worth it. 
                                it was a dark dark scary night and i was home all alone, hungry and scared, all of the sudden the hunger kicked in and i walked in the kitchen, opened the fridge and there it was, a big juicy hunk of meat with onions, pepper, and one medium sized egg.  without a second thought i clenched my teeth into it and mmmmmmmmm oh my lord it was so meaty and loafy. my night was made. it just... just... magical."
2,"This recipe was definitely easy to make but I wasn&apos;t sure of the brown sugar mixture that goes on top and sure enough when my husband tried it, he said it was like eating desert and dinner at the same time. He said it was way to sweet and that he couldnt taste the meat b/c of all the breadcrumbs. May want to cut back to less than 3/4 cup. He made me promise not to make this again. Personally, I thought it was ok."
5,"Excellent and Authentic recipe!  A little more work and ingredients, but well worth it.  Use FRESH basil for more flavor - I use about 1/2 - 2/3 cup fresh chopped basil.  It cooks down and is sooo aromatic.  The mix of sausage and beef is sublime, so no need for more salt.  I always add a dash of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture (an old italian secret!).  I usually make this a day ahead for the flavors and herbs to meld in the fridge then let it sit at room temperature for about 1 hour before baking. Have made for company too, and always get RAVES on it&apos;s authenticity.  Great, winter comfort food and feeds a lot of people.  Another tip for lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles.  Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of very hot tap water for 20-30 min.  Noodles won&apos;t be cooked but soft, and can complete it&apos;s cooking in the oven.  I learned this from a caterer - try it!"
5,"I made this recipe using some tips and tricks from previous reviewers and from my experience having worked in an italian restaurant.  This recipe does not have to be as time intensive as is recommended in the instructions.  As another reviewer noted, it is not necessary to cook the noodles--just soak them in hot water while you are cooking the rest of the ingredients.  You also do not need to cook the sauce.  Sounds bizarre, but it&apos;s true.  If you make the lasagna ahead and leave it in the fridge overnight, the flavors blend perfectly, no cooking required.  For a chunkier tomato sauce, I subbed 1/2 of the crushed tomatoes with diced italian-flavored tomatoes.  I layered everything in this order: sauce-noodles-ricotta mixture-sauce-meat-shredded mozzerella...i did 3 layers like this and then finished with a layer of noodles, sauce and shredded mozzerella and a generous sprinkling of parmesean on top.  Following this method, I had the whole thing put together and in the fridge in less than an hour.  It sat overnight and my husband had it in the oven when I got home from work.  Fantastic recipe!"
5,"WOW! This really is World&apos;s Best Lasagna! From reading all the reviews, I made these changes: Added an additional 1/2 pound of ground meat, omitted the salt, doubled the onions, all the spices, the parsley, canned tomatoes, paste, and sauce. I also doubled the filling ingredients and made three layers instead of two. Everyone raved about the lasagna and I have sauce left over for another use. 
                                SIDE NOTE: For anyone who thinks they don&apos;t like ricotta cheese: Buy it at an Italian market. Brands such as Sierra or Polly-O. There is no comparison to the taste or texture of supermarket brands. I think that&apos;s why I see recipes with regular cottage cheese instead of riccota. I don&apos;t use supermarket riccota under any circumstances, it&apos;s just plain nasty!"
5,"I&apos;ve convinced 3 (now-ex) boyfriends, my husband, and even a couple Italian friends at school that I make the most incredible lasagna they&apos;ve ever tasted with this recipe. I make it pretty much as shown, except if I have the time, I let the sauce simmer on the stove as long as possible. I also add a bit of whatever red wine I have on hand to the sauce. And I try to make a double recipe, so I can use the sauce for other things - it works wonderfully for Chicken Parmesan, plain ol&apos; spaghetti, and anywhere else you&apos;d use a red sauce.
                                
                                Everything tastes better the second day, too. Oh, one more thing - I never boil my noodles. I simply buy regular dried noodles, and make sure I have plenty of sauce in the lasagna. It cooks long enough that the noodles boil in the oven, and you end up with a lasagna that isn&apos;t runny and holds its shape well."
5,"I read all the reviews and really followed ""Cookerbob""&apos;s advise. Here&apos;s what I changed: used 1 lb. LEAN gr. beef tripled the garlic reduced sugar to 1 T. reduced salt to 1 t. used 9 lasagna noodles per pan and used 1 pound mozzarella (shredded) cheese per pan. I read the reviews about omitting the fennel and I have to disagree. I believe the fennel is one of the ingredients that makes this dish outstanding. I made the sauce the day before and simmered for 6 hours. Sounds like a lot of work but come on! How hard is it to check a pot simmering??! I had enough sauce for 2 pans of lasagna so that&apos;s what I did. Made 2 baked one and froze the other. I just finally made my frozen one yesterday. I allowed it to thaw in the fridge overnight and then baked as directed. Just as delicious as the first batch!!! My hubby is a lasagna snob and says this is the best lasagna recipe ever. I totally agree!"
1,"I was so disappointed with this lasagna! I won&apos;t be using this recipe again. With such a high rating, I thought it would taste better. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only used 1/3 of the salt called for. (One serving of the original recipe is almost a full daily allowance of sodium.) It was still too salty. It tasted like something you&apos;d buy in the freezer section at the grocery store. Why waste all that time making it at home if it doesn&apos;t taste any better than the manufactured stuff and isn&apos;t any healthier? There also seemed to be too much sauce and not enough of the ricotta mixture or mozzarella. Suggestions: 1. Leave out the added salt altogether. There&apos;s already enough salt in the sausage, parmesan and canned tomato products to season everything. 2. Drain the meat after browning and before adding anything else. All that saturated fat does nothing to improve the flavor. 3. Use oregano instead of Italian seasoning and leave out the fennel. Italian sausage already has fennel in it. 4. Leave out one of the cans of tomato paste. The condensed tomato flavor was so strong it drowned out the spices. 5. Use a full 16-oz block of mozzarella, and grate it instead of slicing it. You&apos;ll get more even coverage. 6. Double the ricotta mixture (ricotta, egg, parsley). 7. (Optional) Replace the 1/2 cup of water with 1/2 cup of red wine, preferably chianti or cabernet sauvignon."
5,"I quadrupled this recipe for 32 men, and it went over so well ... they came back for seconds, and asked for the recipe for their wives ... now how many men do you know that ask for a recipe?  I made a few changes to this recipe based on past reviews and am glad I did ... here are my suggestons ... use fresh whole wheat lasagna noodles (found in the deli dept.) ... no need to cook them and they come in sheets ... make 3 layers for lasagna dish ... therefore, you would require 8 fresh lasagna sheets ... I had to read through a lot of reviews to figure out what to do with the italian sausage, as it doesn&apos;t explan in the recipe how to cook that ... what you do is buy mild italian sausages (couldn&apos;t find sweet italian sausage and I understand through most reviews that most people can&apos;t) ... you then remove the casing around the sausage, remove the meat and fry the meat until cooked in a frying pan ... instead of using 1 tbsp. salt in the sauce, I used 1 tsp. ... and it was perfect ... I suggest going with your taste ... same thing with the sugar ... go with your personal taste ... the layers were a little difficult to figure out so here is what works ... make 3 layers ... first layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... 2nd layer is meat sauce, noodles, ricotta cheese mixture (add a little nutmeg for taste), parmesan cheese ... 3rd layer is meat sauce, noodles, mozzarella cheese, and parmesan cheese ... defiitely add the fennel seeds ... gives great f"
5,"This was very good. It didn&apos;t fit in my 9 x 13 pan, but worked out fine by placing part of the ingredients in a loaf pan. Caution: skip the tablespoon of salt! (Have you EVER heard of a recipe that calls for a full tablespoon?) Between the cheeses and the canned tomato products, no additional salt was needed. This recipe would easily be a base for your favorite additions: spinach, mushrooms, zucchini, etc. Other reviewers were absolutely correct: plan to make this the day before serving. It makes all the difference in the blending of flavors and incredible taste. I served this with homemade cheese bread and a crisp green salad."
5,"I am giving this 5 stars b/c all of my friends liked it and asked me for the recipe!  I made this for my women&apos;s group holiday dinner.  I would personally give it 4 stars.  It was a bit too meaty for me and there didn&apos;t seem to be enough ricotta (but I know a lot of peopele don&apos;t like ricotta anyways).  I followed a couple reviewer&apos;s suggestions and soaked the noodles in a large roasting pan (try it -there is plenty of room to allow the noodles to lay flat) in VERY hot tap water for about 30 minutes. I added the browned meat / garlic / onion mixture to the tomatoes, paste, sauce, seasonings, etc. WITHOUT simmering.  I assembled the lasagna the evening before (sauce, 6 noodles, ricotta, mozzarella slices, sauce, Parmesan, exact same layer again and sprinkled with shredded mozzarella and rest of Parm).  I purchased a 1 lb. package of sliced mozzarella and ended up using all of it (and it turned out fine).  Also purchased mild Italian sausage (not the sweet stuff - couldn&apos;t find it).  Be sure to use fresh parsley.  It gives the dish nice color and adds a fresh taste that you won&apos;t get from the dried stuff.  Also, be sure to add fennel seed.  It really adds  nice flavor to the dish.  Leftovers were yummy.  I took some to my parents, and my mom had one square.  My dad ate the other 4!  This one&apos;s a keeper, and is worthy of all stars because of the compliments - and shortcuts.  Try them, they REALLY, REALLY work!.  Thanks!"
3,"Many other reviewers have noted that - as written - the lasagna needs to be watched carefully for appropriate cook time. That pretty much negates the benefit of a crockpot approach for me (I prefer to just start the food, then not worry about it.) What the recipe is really missing is WATER. Before assembling, mix your tomato sauce with equal parts water. Use that as your tomato mixture. With the extra water, the recipe won&apos;t turn out as dry. It will take longer to cook - about 6-8 hours on low. The benefit there is you can pretty much go to work, run errands, etc. while your food cooks. Now it makes sense as a crockpot recipe again."
5,"We really enjoyed this!! I did some playing around with it as others have. Replaced the cottage cheese with Ricotta and I used more tomato sauce and paste to make more of the sauce as I have one of the old crockpots that&apos;s just huge. I also put in some Italian seasoning and some roasted garlic. Just make sure that all your noodles are covered with the sauce and it will come out just great. The time was a little different for me too. It only took about 4 1/2 to 5 hours in my pot, but you have to remember that all crockpots are not the same, the size and shape can change the timing a great deal.  I&apos;ve made this twice now and it has come out wonderful both times. I serve it with Mama D&apos;s Italian bread (from this site) and a salad and what a meal!!  Thanks Kim for a great way to make homemade lasagna without all the fuss!"
5,"This turned out very well! Delicious and filling. Of course, I had to read the reviews before attempting this. First, yes, do away with the salt entirely. The pasta sauce will have enough of it. Second, to make the cheese mixture easier to spread (I substituted fat-free ricotta for cottage cheese), add a slightly beaten egg. Finally, make sure that you are using oven-ready/no-boil lasagna noodles (don&apos;t cook them beforehand) instead of the regular kind. They will absorb the liquids and therefore cook on their own. It really does depend on your pot, but my lasagna cooked in just under four hours. The sides were slightly burned (but I like it that way... and I&apos;m thankful I sprayed the pot with Pam before adding the ingredients). Next time I think I might add some drained canned mushrooms to the sauce to make sure that I get my serving of vegetables, since I will definitely make this again (no more Stouffer&apos;s for me)."
4,"If all items are preassembled and put in the &apos;fridge the night before, it needs to only be in the slow cooker for half the recommended time."
5,"This is such a hit!  I have made it several times before and people always ask for the recipe.  Today was the first time I brought it to work and everyone raved about it.  Normally, I follow the recipe, but this time I added a big jar of Ragu to the hamburger, onion, and garlic.  I add extra mozzarella on top in the last hour so it is cheesier on top.  I also cooked it for 1 hour on low and 2 1/2 hours on high and it was wonderful.  The noodles were just right.  I will continue to make this often.  Thank you."
5,"We did a lot of changes but loved it.  We used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage, used fresh basil in the sauce mixture, added jar sauce over the top of the filled crock pot and topped off with some of the saved mozzeralla cheese the last 30 minutes.  This is easy and a keeper."
5,"Delicious and perfect. I feel it&apos;s a good idea to read every review if possible, at least skim them, because everyone&apos;s crockpot and experience is different and you can avoid costly mistakes. I did that and was able to make the adjustments that made this dish turn out wonderful. This was the first dish I made in my new 6-quart slow cooker (call me lasagna lover). I used 3 cups jarred spaghetti sauce, 1 cup water, and half a can diced tomatoes in juice because I had it left over from another day. I added an egg to the ricotta and used minced dried onion instead of a fresh one, and garlic powder. Also added some Italian spices, not too much, and no salt. I used 12 oz. whole wheat lasagna, the regular kind, not precooked. I cooked the whole dish on low for EXACTLY 4 hours, and it turned out heavenly. I think a lot of the problem of dry, chewy noodles comes from overcooking...do not be tempted to keep on cooking. Cover the noodles in sauce and mozzarella, and you will be fine. I didn&apos;t use the high setting at all. Will repeat often."
4,I substituted 2-jars of spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes onions and garlic. Added minced garlic (from the jar) oregano italian seasoning and salt to taste. Also I added italian sausage to the hamburger. It came out delicious but a bit overcooked at 8-hours in the crock pot. Next time I will adjust to 6-hours.
1,I hated this lasagne. It was VERY salty and I saw no benefit to cooking it in the slow cooker. No time was saved. It&apos;s faster to cook lasagne in the oven and the taste was lacking. I&apos;ll stick with my tried and true lasagne recipe from Bon Appetit!
5,"These were amazing leftover! Normally I don&apos;t like burgers leftover- they dry out and lose their flavor. But these kept their mositure and the flavor was great when I reheated one 2 days after I had initially made them. I made these small and served them on sweet Hawaiian rolls and topped them with cheese, tomato, and additional onion (since I love onion)."
5,"It sounds like the person who gave this recipe one star didn’t even make it—how unfair--nor did he read the description correctly.  The ‘traditional’ to which the contributor is referring, is that they served it with cheese, ketchup and on a bun—like a ‘traditional’ hamburger.  Re Klupskies not being a word (really???), this is what this family called them—much like a nickname—does that mean it can’t be a good recipe? Plus, there are many family variations to most ‘traditional’ recipes –including Kotlety Mielone. Two wrongs don’t make a right, but maybe it will help, so I’m giving 5 stars without making it to help offset a very unfair and pompous review."
5,These were really yummy! A really nice variance on the typical burger. I used red onion and the flavor was fantastic. I made these burgers on the grill and topped them with white American cheese. The bread in these burgers helps to keep the moisture in the meat. I&apos;m saving this recipe and will be making them again very soon.
5,I made these with lean 85/15ground beef and red onion. The flavor from the onion and green pepper was wonderful. The bread seems to help keep the burgers moist and it&apos;s not too much bread even when putting the burgers on buns. I had leftovers and when I reheated a for lunch it was still very moist and the flavor was even better the next day.
5,These burgers were very moist and juicy and the flavor from the green pepper and the onion was fantastic. I grilled these and they turned out perfect- the green peppers and onion cooked perfectly in the meat and gave it a great flavor. I might have to make these instead of regular burgers from now on.
4,These are pretty good and quixk. My wife is Polish and this is the way her Mom made them when she was a kid so she really likes them.
4,My Gramma made these my whole life but with a few differences. She used only finely ground pork butts (shoulder) with all the fat trimmed. She grated an onion into the meat used 4 pieces of dried bread also grated added parsley and salt & pepper. She lightly fried them until they browned some but weren&apos;t hard. Then she baked them for about a half hour at 350. Have made these for all my friends over the years and they&apos;ve always been a BIG hit.
5,After making thesw twice they have become the new favorite for my family. The flavor is awesome and they are SO good leftover. I do not like leftover hamburgers but these keep the flavor and the moisture and I have no problem eating them days later. On a side note I like these on a potato bun with white american cheese and topped with additional grilled onion.
5,I couldn&apos;t make the all polish version of this so I made a Polish/Mexican version instead. I am on a limited budget and did not have any green pepper but had all the other ingredients so I used some jalapenos in an escabeche mixture instead. So I ciselered the jalapeno mixture and WOW these were AWESOME.
2,tasted like meatloaf and they fell apart to easy n quick. Couildnt really make it a burger. could flavor though
4,"Pretty tasty stuff. I did my own thing with it though. While browning the  beef I seasoned it with onion powder, garlic powder, freshly ground black pepper, and a smidge of salt. I chopped up one small onion, and after draining the beef I mixed the beef, cream of mushroom soup, and chopped onions together and let them simmer a bit. Then poured the mixture into a 10x10 casserole dish. I added sharp cheddar. Then put the tots on, then added triple cheddar shredded cheese on top of the tots. My family loved it including my 2 year old who typically doesn&apos;t eat beef!"
5,"This popped up this a.m. and remiinded me of how long it&apos;s been since I&apos;d fixed this quick & delicious casserole.  Versatile...turkey, beef, pork, lamb meats, tomato or cream based soups work, add a layer of grean beans, carrots or corn and you have a complete meal.  Vary the spices & it&apos;s a new casserole each time you make it.   Thanks barryzimm for bringing back one of our faves."
4,"I love this recipie. My family has used it for years. It is something thay you can even make the day before and put in your fridge. I do add a few things though, after i brown my hamburger I add fresh or canned mushrooms as well as some frozen vegetables. You can add what ever you want. I usually add corn and peas. I also put some cheese under the tatertots and a little on top of the tater tots. This allows them to get crispy."
5,"I run a kitchen in a nursing home. We made this recipe this week for our residents. It was such a hit everyone came back for seconds and thirds!!!! Staff and family members had me print the recipe so they could make it home. I had my cook use Lawry&apos;s instead of salt plus we cooked the burger with fresh onions, mushrooms & garlic. I&apos;m making it for my family tonight??"
4,"I have used this recipe for years.   It was a favorite of one of the ladies in our church and always appeared at pot-lucks.   
                                Nick----it may not be the ""nuevo cuisine"" you are probably use to eating---but as a former home economist, it definitely isn&apos;t trash cooking.   Most families and kids love it and it certainly is an economical dish to prepare.  Serve it with a green salad or green veggies if the nutrition level upsets you."
4,"I love this recipe and my son loves it too one of his favorite dishes!!! My grandma made this for me growing up and still love it to this day i make it a little different tho but like i said tastes great i brown 1 to 1 1/2 lbs ground beef with onions(optional) drain grease from meat (& onions if use) then i take a can of cream of mushroom soup, a can of either french style cut green beans or reg.cut green beans (drained) and mix together then add to beef and layer on bottom of 9×13 pan then sprinkle a small layer of shredded cheddar cheese then i add a layer of tater tots and then i add more shredded cheese on top bake in 350° oven for about 30-35 min or until cheese is bubbling then sprinkle(cover)top with french&apos;s french fried onions and put back in oven until fried onions are crispy take out and enjoy!!!!!"
5,I add a packet of dry french onion  soup mix and a can of French style green beans. Love this!
4,"the only thing i changed was i prefer it with peppers and onions (they make everything better though, dont they?)"
1,awful
5,"I halved this recipe but still kept the whole onion and peppers. I also couldn&apos;t find a red jalapeno, so used a green. The spice was just perfect for us and really had a great flavored soup base. Our guest don&apos;t eat spicy food at all and although they cleaned their bowls, they said it was a wee bit more spicy than they would make, but did like it. I didn&apos;t make the sour cream topping, since our guest don&apos;t really like cilantro, but it does sound good."
5,"My boyfriend raves about his ex girlfriends chili and I&apos;ve never made chili before. I had to search and search for the perfect recipe to show her up. Lol found this recipe and decided to try it. I couldn&apos;t find red peppers so I used 3 jalapeños. I added a can of rotel chipotle tomatoes. Everything else kept the same. Took to work for chili cook off and I got tons of compliments and was told several times, best chili they ever ate including my boyfriend!  Oh...and I won the contest. I make this often now.  Best chili ever!!!"
5,"Absolutely a great recipe. I could not find a red jalapeno pepper so I used two large red chili peppers. I increased the chili powder and cumin to 3 tablespoons each because I like mine a bit more spicy. I always use Conecuh Sausage in my chili recipes so I added 3/4 pound of that, fried and cut into small pieces. I did not have fire roasted tomatoes so I used 1 can of regular Rotel instead. I could not find a Anaheim pepper so I used a Poblano pepper instead. I cooked this in my Crock Pot for 6 hours. Other than these modifications I followed the recipe as written. I considered my personal recipe to be the best out there but this one beat me hands down. It will become my new recipe from now on. Simply a blue ribbon recipe for chili."
5,"I had to find a chili recipe for my office&apos;s chili cook off and found this recipe.  Read the reviews, especially about the one that claimed to have won their work&apos;s cook off and decided to make it.  Imagine my delight when I too won the chili cook off.  Everyone at the office raved about it.  It is hands down a winner and great tasting to boot.  I prepared all the ingredients and fried the meat and veggies the night before, placed all the ingredients in the crockpot and put it in the fridge overnight.  Cooked it over four hours on high in the crockpot the following day.  The chili was nice and thick and tasty, cooked to perfection.  Great choice."
4,"Really good recipe with good depth of flavor. Although it seemed to be missing that umami element that makes you go, ""oh my gosh!"" and I&apos;m entering it into a contest tomorrow being judged by some local celebrity chefs (I&apos;m in Nashville). 
                                
                                So I decided to take it in a bit of a Sante Fe direction and added diced Hatch green chilis and a 1.5 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  Now I got the ""oh my gosh!""... I&apos;m also using Mexican crema blended with cumin and cilantro to drizzle across the top and I am deep frying thin slices of the Hatch chilis to garnish for texture.  I&apos;m competing against 10 others so we&apos;ll see how I do!
                                
                                UPDATE: I took first place! Thanks again for the recipe..."
5,My new go-to chili recipe. It is perfect.
1,"The tomato paste was ""way to much"", it over powers the other spices. My advice is to start with about 4,OZ and add to it if not delete it altogether."
5,"I am the primary cook in my house and cooking is kinda a hobby of mine. Needles to say my 8 kids eat well. I have been using a recipe that my mom used to make that I had tweaked over the years. But decided it was time to try something new as and found this highly rated recipe. 
                                
                                When I showed this to my wife for an ingredients run she thought I was nuts trying to make what sounds like a very spicy chili. Well I made a couple of minor mods and was very pleasantly surprised. My slightly modified version will be my new go to for chili. All of my kids liked it over grandma&apos;s recipe ad did all of my employees. 16 servings gone in the first 24 hours served and lots of compliments. No one complained that it was to spicy. 
                                
                                Made a 36 serving batch of this chili since I have so many  kids to feed and we like to freeze ready made meals. Since I have a variety of heat tolerances in my family I toned down the heat by only adding 1/2 of the chili powder  the recipe called for. Also omitted the tomato paste as there were several people who had gripped about it. I also added cubed steak, pork sausage and black beans. 
                                
                                Next time I&apos;ll make a bigger batch :)"
4,"Delicious.  Made exactly as directed (other than I only added 4 oz tomato paste)  To all the reviewers who modified the recipe  (other than the amount of tomato paste which must be a mistake), once you change the recipe, you are not reviewing this recipe  anymore, but your own modified take of it.  We want to know how this recipe is, not your version of it."
5,"Awesome recipe...I only made a few little changes, first I added diced cubanelle peppers to the garlic and onions, I didn&apos;t have sour cream so I used a little bit of mayo (I was sorprised that work out very very well) I used italian breadcrumbs and to the sauce I added a little bit of steak sauce and some maple syrup...Delicioso!! uh, I almost forgot, I placed two slices of regular bread at the bottom of the pan before put it in the oven, that way the bread suck all the grease from the meat...when it is done, just discard the bread..Thanks for sharing!!!"
5,"ooh my goooooodness, this truly is the best meatloaf I have ever tasted in my life. My husband and two little children loved it. My daughter is a really picky eater especially when it comes to meat, but she ate it all down to the last drop. I absolutely recommend this recipe to every one. I will most definitely be making this again. I can not wait to have a get together so that I can share it with others. I gave this recipe 5 stars only because that was the highest option available. It was greeeaaaattttt!!!!!!!"
5,"This recipie was great, I did change it around alittle. I used italian bread crumbs instead of the bread and crackers,and I used garlic powder and onion salt instead of cooking garlic and onion in butter. I also forgot to use the milk. The meat was pretty moist I didn&apos;t need it anyway. This was great will use it again. Thanks"
5,"This was the first meatloaf I have ever made and the only real change I made was to use Italian Breadcrumbs and a dash of Italian Seasoning and it was phenomenal!  I didn&apos;t have a meat thermometer, but the timing was perfect!  I was so impressed with myself!!  ;o)  My husband took one bite and said it tasted like his mom&apos;s!  I take that as a compliment!  I think next time I will use 1/2 ground sirloin and 1/2 ground pork as another suggested--it sounds good, but otherwise, it was incredible!"
5,"I made this tonight for my family and it was great meatloaf!! The only thing I changed on this recipe was I used ground turkey instead of ground beef (huge beef recall happening right now...don&apos;t want to chance the Mad Cow thing!). Anyway...this turkey meatloaf was absolutely fantastic!! Oh yeah...one other thing I did was use a cup of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the sliced bread. My whole family said this was ""the best meatloaf I have ever made."" So I&apos;m thinking you titled this recipe perfectly!:) Will make this again!! Buon Appetite!"
5,"My husband and I (who are NOT big meatloaf fans) loved the heck out of this recipe. It was painfully simple and simply delicious. It&apos;s not too ketchupy, which I really like. I might add some seasonings (perhaps an Italian blend) the next time around just to experiment with the taste a little. It was very moist and a certain keeper in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing it!"
5,"Having been on the hunt for a good meatloaf recipe for some time now, I am thrilled to have found this one. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added maple syrup rather then milk, Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, and mayo instead of sour cream (we never keep sour cream stocked in our house). Although moist, it held together beautifully. I topped it off with a glaze (1/2 cup ketchup, 4 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp whit vinegar) when I turned the oven temperature up for the remaining 15 minutes. Perfect. Will stop the hunt with this one!!"
5,"I followed the baking instructions exactly, but not the ingredient list. I added onion powder, garlic powder, left out the bread, and added something I learned from an old roomate: horseradish! While there is no accounting for taste (no such thing as &apos;too&apos;spicy or &apos;too&apos; many onions), the baking process seemed to be spot on, especially  in regard to turning it up to 400.... thanks."
5,This was the first time I ever made meatloaf and I was very pleased with how it came out. It was moist and flavorful and just delicious. Even my picky 2 year old liked it. I froze some of the leftovers for later and it worked quite well. I will definitely be making this one again. Update: I used ground sirloin the last time I made this and it was to die for!
1,"Sorry, we tried this exactly and we did not care for it at all - too mushy with all of the different kinds bread crumbs and we did not care for the taste that the tomato sauce gave it.  We will stick with our original Meatloaf recipe."
5,Five stars and an A+. This is the perfect basic sloppy joes recipe. I won&apos;t be buying the canned stuff anymore. We like ours just a little stickier so added 1/2 cup water and a tablespoon of quick oats then simmered it down. MMM  Next time I&apos;m going to double it so I can freeze the extra. I fill the cups in a muffin tin with the leftovers and freeze. When frozen just pop them out and store in a Ziploc bag in the freezer. Each one is the perfect size for a bun and ready to microwave at a seconds notice.
5,Best sloppy joes ever! My boyfriend absolutely loved it...instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup I only used 1/2 and replaced the other 1/4 with barbecue sauce. It turned out perfect..not too ketchupy or anything...oh and I also skipped the brown sugar - only because the barbecue sauce I was using already had brown sugar in it.
5,"I browned the ground beef, onion and green pepper. I then put the remaining ingredients into a crock pot and cooked on low for about 3-4 hours.  This recipe was really simple & delicious."
4,"This is wonderful!  My family loves this when I slice the top off hogie buns, hollow out the shell, stuff with the hot Sloppy Joe meat, top with cheese and broil until the cheese melts. Save the bread from the buns for crumbs or whatever you need them for.  I freeze mine."
5,"Much better than Manwich and SO easy!  The best thing is it&apos;s made with ingredients I always have in the house and it&apos;s not a hundred ingredients either so it&apos;s fast to make.  I always make more sauce than it calls for, I think it&apos;s too dry otherwise.  If I make it with 1 lb. of meat I double the sauce, 2 lbs. I triple it, 3 lbs. I quadruple it, etc.  It&apos;s great in the crockpot too; I make it in the morning when I have a minute and it sits in the crockpot on low all day.  I&apos;ve passed this recipe on to anyone who will take it."
5,"Absolutely delicious. This is the perfect recipe for sloppy joes in my opinion. People complain about the reviews being overrated because this isn&apos;t all jazzed-up into something special. Well what do you expect, it&apos;s only sloppy joes! I haven&apos;t had sloppy joes in years, and I am so glad I chose this recipe to finally have a taste of some. The only thing I would definitely change is the simmer time. Even on the lowest fire I had to cut it down to 20 min. instead of the original 30 because it started sticking to the pan. But it was finished by then any way and the flavors have already come out from the seasonings. This was AWESOME! A definite keeper. If you would like to simmer for the full 30 min, follow the advice of others and add just a bit of water and/or extra ketchup. This also adds more sloppiness. Yum!"
5,"Our family loves this recipe (I make it a lot). I have to double it for my family of five (makes great leftovers, if there are any). I also add 2-3 tsp of white vinegar, a tsp of Worcestershire sauce, and some tomato paste. Quick, simple, and DEEEELICIOUS!"
5,"This is a wonderful, easy basic recipe, as the high ratings can attest.  However, for those who tend to find this too sweet, don&apos;t add the brown sugar until the last, at the same time you adjust the S&P. If you find it doesn&apos;t need the sugar, skip it; or add just a tiny bit at a time until you like it.  Or try 1/2-1 tsp. molasses instead of the br. sugar to add depth of flavor without much sweetness.  
                                
                                Still too sweet? You might also need to substitute tomato sauce for the ketchup (in which case you might want to add a bit of additional spices.) 
                                
                                If you have already made the recipe as listed, and find it too sweet, DON&apos;T THROW IT OUT!  Remember that acids are sour and will offset the sweetness. Therefore, add a splash of vinegar or unsweetened tomato products (such as tomato paste or chopped tomatoes) a little at a time until the sweetness is corrected to your tastes. Then follow the steps above next time you make this.
                                
                                Don&apos;t pass up this quick, easy, tasty recipe without tweaking it to suit your family&apos;s tastes! :)"
5,"This went over big at the fire station. Adjusted the recipe for ten and barely fed 8!! To make the sauce a little ""sloppier"" instead of addind more ketchuo, I added chicken gumbo soup."
3,"This was good, but not my favorite.  It was a little bit too sweet for us.  I also didn&apos;t really like the green bell  pepper taste with it.  I think I will keep using my own recipe.  Thanks for the post."
5,"I have used this for years. I have played around with it a little and found that a teaspoon of sugar cuts the acidity of the tomatoes. And if you want to make it taste a little richer, stir in a quarter cup of cream before serving. Also, I drain grease off the beef before adding any vegetables, that way you aren&apos;t pouring out all your garlic/onion flavour!"
3,"Easy, painless, and tastes good. I will def use as a base recipe again. Maybe it&apos;s in the asian in me that likes to marinate everything... but if you marinate the beef in 2 tb of soy sauce, 1 tsp sugar, 2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a 1/4 of salt for 15 minutes before sauteing...it adds a world of difference to the flavor in the beef.  It no longer just just tastes like tomato sauce drenched in flavorless meat.  Also add salt and pepper to the meat (to taste) while sauteing with the onions and garlic and peppers before adding to the sauce."
5,"I love this recipe and it has become my favorite with a couple of small changes.  I like my sauce more creamy with the tomatoes less chunky, so I use ""crushed"" instead of diced tomatoes.  I love mushrooms, so I also add a 7 ounce jar (drained) of button mushrooms (usually Pennsylvania Dutchman available at my regular grocery).  The button type mushrooms are good because they are easy to see in the sauce and can be left off the spoon for those eaters who don&apos;t like them."
4,This recipe was very easy and tasty.  It&apos;s a really hearty sauce and next time I&apos;ll add sauteed mushrooms.  I&apos;ll certainly make it again!!
5,"Great recipe! I looked through the reviews as I always do because I get a kick out of some of them. I saw one that said ""I used this instead of this and didn&apos;t use as much of this and it seemed to be missing something"". I&apos;m all for improving a recipe if it needs it but don&apos;t change the recipe and then leave a review that reflects something completely different than you&apos;re reviewing."
5,"We used this recipe for a benefit where we fed over 400 people, everyone enjoyed it. We increased the ingredients by 500, did the math, added a little more beef than what it called for, but it turned out great and was fairly easy to do. If I am crazy enough to do another benefit, we will use this recipe."
5,"Five stars for a quick, easy, delicious recipe!  I DID use 1 1/2 lbs beef and a large can (29oz) of diced tomatoes (I wanted a little extra sauce), but those were the only changes.  Thanks to Hank&apos;s mom!"
4,"Great basic recipe. I also add a bay leaf, and 1/8 to 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese. An old italian woman taught my mom to add the grated parmesan, it really adds flavor, depth, richness and thickens it."
5,"I absolutely loved this spaghetti sauce and so did my father and brother. I used ""Italian Seasoning"", but other than that, I didn&apos;t have to substitute anything."
5,"This turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Here are the changes I made to what is now my favorite dish. In the gravy, I used a can of French Onion soup as well as a can of Cream of Mushroom and a packet of Dry Onion Soup. I omitted the salt due to the high sodium content in the soups.  I&apos;m glad I did. I doubled the gravy except for the ketchup...kept it at 1/4 cup while doubling the rest.  I also added a jar of mushrooms to the gravy.  After browning each side of the patties (and yes, having them fall apart slightly), I transferred the patties to a foil-lined casserole dish, put the gravy on top, covered the dish, and cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes.  I was worried the patties wouldn&apos;t get all the way done because they were pretty thick, but they turned out perfect!!! We had it with brown rice (and had just enough wonderful gravy to go along with it!) and steamed broccoli. This is a new favorite recipe for my husband and me."
4,"I only rate a recipe if I make it as is, I don&apos;t think it is fair to make changes and then rate a recipe.  So as-is this recipe is really good, 4 stars.  The second time I made it I followed other reviewers advice and added Cream of Mushroom soup and sauteed onions and that made it 5 stars!"
3,"The ""steaks"" themselves were tasty (heavily altered with additional seasonings).  My steaks held their shape quite well.  I cooked 1/2 batch on the stove and another batch in the oven... preferred the taste of the stove cooked batch, but the oven cooked batch tasted good too.  
                                
                                The great disappointment with this recipe was the sauce - it was horrible, to put it kindly!  I followed the advice of others to drastically cut the ketchup - but it didn&apos;t do much for the flavor.  It was far from authentic tasting.  I had extra patties and no sauce (not that I would have used the sauce anyway) - the next day I decided to try using Liptons Mushroom and Onion soup mix for the gravy.  I followed the package instructions for making gravy... DELICIOUS!  It was hands down the best tasting sauce for salisbury steak and so simple to make.    
                                
                                So, if you&apos;re craving an old cafeteria food favorite - don&apos;t waste your time with the recipe for the sauce - buy a box of Lipton Mushroom Onion soup mix and make the gravy with it - you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,"Great and simple recipe as is. Thanks for a new addition to our home cooked meals.
                                
                                *** Note: I just wanted to add that when people completely change a recipe and then rate it low it is somewhat moronic. You are not rating the recipe we are looking at you are rating your own recipe. It really is not the nicest or the most helpful thing to do (IMHO)."
4,"The only reason I gave this recipe four stars is because I ended up doing a lot of tweaking based on other recommendations.  I ended up with a WONDERFUL meal.  I took the following suggestions: I added chopped onion and garlic to meat mixture before browning.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup to French onion soup, and mixed in a small amount of brown gravy mix to give it some color and thickened it up a bit.  I omitted the ketchup and doubled the amount to pour on top of garlic mashed potatoes.  For those who had trouble keeping the patties together, try this as was suggested before.  Instead of cooking in a skillet, place browned patties in a foil-lined casserole dish, pour gravy over top, and bake at 400 for 30 mins.  Your patties will stay together nicely!!"
5,"The best salisbury steak ever!!  The sauce is great...I browned the steaks in a fry pan and then cooked them in the oven with the sauce poured over them for 30 min. at 325 degrees, covered...they were soooo tender and juicy. Family loved it....will make again very soon."
5,i have made this recipe now every week...my husband and kids love this...i use onion soup mix and 2cups of water instead...so i dont add any more water to the sauce..i also add onions to the beef and alittle more bread crumbs...thank you i will keep on cooking this...m
5,"I made the recipe as is and it was really very good. I would never attempt to rate a recipe that I had made ANY changes to as I would not be giving a fair assessment of the recipe as written. It would be like rating my own recipe. I think everyone who posts a recipe has a right to hear what people think of their recipes, as written. Once you tweak it, it&apos;s yours. I liked this just fine. When I make it again, I may alter a few things, but no one here will know about it."
4,"I made this recipe a couple of times ""as is"" - Will give 3 1/2 ***.  Did not like the ketchup and not enough gravy.  After a few modifications... FIVE STARS *****!  Here are the modifications I make each time now (thanks to a compilation of others&apos; suggestions on this site):  1.) Chop up one medium onion (fine) and mix it with the hamburger  2.)  I used 3 TBL Crisco to brown the steaks in the pan (and then drained before I added the gravy 2.) Double the gravy ingredients and omit the ketchup completely 3.) Add 1 can Mushroom Soup, 1 Pkg. Lipton&apos;s Dry Onion Soup Mix and 1/2 Cup brown gravy (I use Campbell&apos;s most of the time, but any brand works fine).  I prepare the steaks on the stove (don&apos;t use the oven as some have suggested), and they turn out perfectly.  Serve with mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and Romaine Salad (with dried cherries or cranberries).  Yummy!"
5,"I made Chef John&apos;s meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I&apos;d double the italian seasoning but that&apos;s really just personal to our family."
5,"These meatballs were awesome! I added more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, left out the red pepper, and used beef broth instead of milk. They were a big hit and I even posted a picture! Thanks Chef John!"
5,"CJ&apos;s Italian Meatballs Haiku: ""I can&apos;t believe it. These beat &apos;Meatball Nirvana&apos; And they held up too!"" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn&apos;t have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn&apos;t fall apart! So I don&apos;t know what of CJ&apos;s method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR&apos;s &apos;Meatball Nirvana&apos; in our house from now on."
5,"Excellent meatballs! They are perfectly seasoned! I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the sautéed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so – everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn’t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I’ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don’t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use."
5,"These meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe as is.
                                No problems with it whatsoever. Thanks Chef John!
                                
                                Fellow members, please refrain from changing the recipe to suit yourself and rate it as if its the exact recipe that is posted.
                                
                                If you make changes, any changes to the recipe, you&apos;re rating your own recipe..Doesn&apos;t make sense."
5,"These are FANTASTIC meatballs! I used meatloaf mix, b/c it was cheaper (believe it or not) than buying the beef and pork seperately.  I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain and dried parsley in place of the fresh. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and would not change a thing next time. I was scared b/c the mixture was so soft (even after refrigeration), but I proceeded on, and I am so glad I didn&apos;t add extra breadcrumbs like I wanted to...these held their shape and were so moist, tender, flavorful and delicious...one of the best I&apos;ve made/eaten! I used my large cookie scoop and got 26 out of this recipe. My family RAVED over these...even my 10 month old twins couldn&apos;t get enough, lol. Seriously, these are sooooo good! I will def be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)"
2,I just took these out of the oven and they were swimming in liquid!!  They weren&apos;t browned or even close - the flavor of the meat is good but the consistency of the cooked meatballs is wrong - won&apos;t make again!
5,"These tasted really good and were super easy to make.  Just a couple of things: I think next time I&apos;ll use maybe a 1/3 cup of milk as they were almost too juicy to form into balls.  Also, next time I will try baking them with a rack in the pan as they really did make a lot of grease and I think they would taste better without sitting in it.  Third, I wish they would have browned up a little better.  I even kept them in the oven for a few more mintutes at 450 and that didn&apos;t help.  But, again, the best tasting meatballs I&apos;ve ever made.  Nothing wrong with the recipe as written, just personal preference, a five star recipe for sure!"
5,"Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn&apos;t disappointed. These meatballs were intended for sub sandwiches with marinara, but after tasting them fresh out of the oven, I felt like I was doing an injustice to this fine specimen of meat by slopping marinara over it. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using this for years."
5,"This is the quickest thing I have made for dinner in a long time.  However, I like my chili on the thicker side, and this chili was a little too watery.  To solve this problem, I added half a can of tomato paste, and this made it perfect.  I also added just a little extra chili powder because I wanted it to be a little spicier.  Because I didn&apos;t have stewed tomatoes, I used canned diced tomatoes instead.  They were just as good and gave the chili a nice flavor.  I have already made this for dinner twice, and I plan on making it a staple in my recipe collection.  It&apos;s great served with a portion of baguette."
5,Wow!!! This chili was GREAT.  This was my first time EVER to make chili.  I added a chopped green pepper and 2 cloves of garlic minced in the pan with the hamburger and onions..  I also used 1 tablespoon of chili powder.. This truly was better than any chili my family has ever had from any restaurant or family member.. Thank you so much.
5,"It has snowed 5 feet here in Denver and I really wanted chili tonight. I can&apos;t believe how easy this was!!! It was sooooooooooooo good. I can&apos;t believe it. I tastes like I worked all day on it. I did make a few changes, I only put 1c. of water, and put about 1TB of chili powder. When I browned the meat I put 2 cloves of garlic in with onion. This was the tastiest dinner I&apos;ve had! Thanks!"
2,"It was good, although I had to make too many changes to the recipe to rate it any higher. I used alot more garlic and chili powder(1-2 tbsp) and I omitted the water completely(I like it thick and it was just too soup-like with the water in it). As the recipe is now it was very bland tasting."
4,"I decided to make chili dogs at the last minute for National Hot Dog Day, I needed something fast. This fit the bill perfectly. I increased the chili powder and garlic powder and added a few more spices (cumin, mexican oregano, crushed red pepper, onion powder, little brown sugar, little Worchestershire sauce) for flavor. This worked out great."
4,This is an easy and simple chili recipe. I used petite diced tomatoes. I usually throw in garlic and green pepper. I use a TON more chili powder than called for here. We like it spicy! We serve this with shredded cheese and sour cream. The kids like to have this over fritos. Every once in a while I will serve this as a taco salad with corn chips and all the fixins.
2,"I don&apos;t see how anyone can rate a recipe 4-5 stars when they have to practically redo it.  I added this, I left out that...put in more seasoning, leave out the water...either a recipe works or it doesn&apos;t AS IS.  This is a basic starter recipe for new cooks or families w/ young children. It doesn&apos;t qualify as 4-5 stars in my book."
5,This was so easy to make and tastes great!! My husband and I both loved it! I only had marinara sauce on hand so I used that in place of the tomato sauce. AND I had to cook the chili a lot longer than 15 minutes to get it thick enough. I&apos;ll definitely be making this one again but I think I&apos;ll add less water next time around...
4,Easy to make and tasty. I added some hot chili powder and barley. Came out very good.
5,"They ARE the best meatballs, even though I use all beef most of the time. I don&apos;t fry, b/c I am too impatient, and the meatballs break up more that way. I scoop them out with a spoon, roll them in my hands, and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way, they brown nicely, excess fat is drained off, and they can go right into sauce, or, in our family, meatball hoagies, along with sauteed onions and peppers. They also freeze very well when baked this way. When I take these to parties, I always get requests for the recipe."
5,"This is soooo close to my Nonna&apos;s authentic Italian recipe! I am telling you, these meatballs ROCK! Uh oh, the word is out!!! How funny! 3 meats, the breadcrumbs, plus 1 egg. You can also use fresh chopped spinach instead of parsley (or 1 pkg frozen, thawed and all water squeezed out) and pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan. I make sure I have these on hand almost all the time, I use one lb of EACH meat, and it makes 30-40. Instead of frying, I par bake mine on a cookie sheet at 325 for about 10 minutes, then set the tray (if room allows) into the freezer for an hour or so. Pop them off the tray, into a couple of large freezer bags. Meatballs on demand!! Drop them into a sauce or steam in a glass casserole dish for about 5 minutes, they will be medium-well on the inside. Absolute crowd pleaser if you are making a big Italian dinner!!"
5,"I use beef, pork, and veal, as it is readily available in my supermarket.  Also, I bake mine instead of frying them, use parchment paper, 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Then, if I have sauce simmering, I drop them in for the finale, or I freeze them for later use, or to give away to the children."
3,"There is nothing I hate more than to get a mediocre or worse review from people who do not follow the recipe as written, and then judge YOU on it. I followed this to a ""T"" even though my experience as a chef was telling me not to. Too much cheese. Not enough garlic. And ""salt and pepper to taste"" is a personal pet peeve. If you are going to post a recipe, include all the measurements, or be prepared to take your lumps. This recipe is good enough to avoid disaster, but DO NOT FRY. They stick to the pan and melt away when you add them to the gravy(tomato sauce). Instead, bake them for about 35 minutes at 350. Then, put them in the gravy for the last hour or two. Replace half the cheese with more breadcrumbs. Less mess, healthier and easier."
5,"Honestly, I was skeptical using water in a meatball recipe, but it was really great!  I scaled to 4 servings, used only beef, 85%, 1/2 cup italian style breadcrumbs and Kraft parmesan cheese, as my young children do not yet appreciate the stronger flavor of ""real"" cheese, and they both said they were the best meatballs ever.  Also, I did not fry them, to cut down on fat and clean-up, and they kept their shape just fine.  I just put them in the gravy and cooked them on simmer for 30 minutes.  The sauce was a simple marinara, just sautee 2 cloves of garlic, add 3 cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 can paste, 3/4 c. water and simmer.  Add 1T oregano, 1t. basil, 1t. onion powder, salt and pepper and voila!  Geanine and I teamed up to make an awesome dinner!  Thanks Geanine!"
5,"This IS the best Italian Meatball recipe ever.  My ex-mother-in-law gave me this recipe more than 25 years ago.  We use italian style breadcrumbs and much less liquid (about 1/4 cup milk). What makes it so good is the ratio of meats.  You can adjust the flavorings to suit your family&apos;s taste.  Once browned, the meatballs can finish cooking in the frypan or by baking, or even add them to the sauce.  I would recommend this basic recipe to anyone.  Excellent addition to Allrecipes.com."
5,"Thank you Geanine!  My husband told me that these were absolutely the best meatballs he had ever tried!  I didn&apos;t pan fry them in olive oil - I simply dropped them into a crockpot full of homemade spaghetti sauce and let them cook with the sauce all afternoon.  Also, I used italian style bread crumbs instead of making my own - just used a third cup less.  My husband absconded with the leftovers to take to work this morning, and three people from his office called me today to get the recipe!  Will ALWAYS use this recipe for spaghetti and meatballs!"
5,"Wow, This is the way that I make my meatballs (recipe from my Mom, not some cookbook), but instead of using water, we use milk, and soak the bread in it, and also skip the olive oil browning, as the meat produces enough fat for the browning proceedure.  Thanks Geanine!"
5,"Exactly the way I make them, except I don&apos;t use quite as much water and I don&apos;t fry them. I drop them in the sauce to cook.  Makes the sauce taste awesome."
2,"Try RICOTTA CHEESE instead of sour cream and skip the provolone for a real Italian version of Baked Ziti. Mix an egg into a pound of ricotta to make it nice and creamy, and toss with the ziti. Layer sauce first (so you don&apos;t need to butter the pan), then ziti/cheese, mozzarella, sprinkle with parm and a little dried oregano or basil, then repeat layers. For a really nice look, slice a brick of mozzarella for the top layer instead of using the shredded kind. This is SO MUCH BETTER than the sour cream version!"
5,"Hey yo, what&apos;s up fellow cookers??  Check it...I hate when people give extraordinary recipes ratings that they don&apos;t deserve.  I sort my recipies by ""most helpful."" Every person that I know who knows anything about cooking KNOWS to cover up whatever it is that they are baking so it won&apos;t dry up.  Now that I got that off my chest, I just want to say that this is definitely ""HALL OF FAME"" material.  I didn&apos;t make any changes to the recipe with the exception of how I layered it.  I read some of the other reviews and decided to put the sauce mixture directly on top of the ziti, then add the cheese, sour cream and so forth.  I even stirred the bottom layer of ziti and sauce together before I added anything else just to make sure that the sauce ran all through the noodles.  I may try Ricotta cheese next time just to see the difference in taste or may mix Ricotta with the sour cream. Grease the pan real well before you put anything in it....or just use a non-stick cooking spray.  If you like your meals cheesier, meatier or saucier, than you can add a little more, but that&apos;s strictly on your preference.  Oh yeah.......keep in mind that this meal does make a huge dish so you might want to have a smaller baking dish on the side for any extra that doesn&apos;t fit in the first one.  Better safe than sorry.....and trust...YOU WON&apos;T BE SORRY FOR MAKING THIS AT ALL!!!!"
3,"I&apos;m rating this only a 3 star because the recipe doesn&apos;t tell you to bake it COVERED!  I baked uncovered and it dried out.  Not good, and certainly not ""Hall of Fame"" worthy.  I&apos;ll try it again, but definitely covered when baking."
5,"Just made this dish for dinner tonight and it was delicious. Instead of greasing the pan (I used a Pyrex dish) with butter, I sprayed a light coating of Pam; the pan was a breeze to clean afterward. Per some of the suggestions other reviewers made, I added minced garlic and had put the sauce directly on the ziti, before the provolone. Because I like the pasta to soak up the flavor of the sauce, I did the same for the top layer ziti, (adding the sauce to the ziti before the mozerella cheese). Since I wasn&apos;t sure if doing so would make the pasta too soft, I shaved a minute off of the suggested pasta boiling time. It came out perfect, this recipe is a keeper."
5,"I love this recipe!  It gets five stars because, made as directed, it&apos;s absolutely delicious; creamy, savory and just perfect.  If I could give this recipe more stars, I would, because it&apos;s also extremely flexible.  I&apos;ve made this with Italian sausage or ground turkey instead of the beef.  I&apos;ve also made a vegetarian version by substituting sliced zucchini and mushrooms for the meat.  Sometimes I add chopped garlic and fennel seed.  (There&apos;s something about fennel seed that, to me, is integral to Italian cooking.  It&apos;s like cilantro to Mexican food.)  Obviously, the key to the greatness of this recipe is the substitution of a layer of sour cream and provolone for the usual ricotta.  That&apos;s what makes the dish so moist and creamy.  Who hasn&apos;t make a beautiful lasagna only to have it dry out in the oven?  I like ricotta as much as the next Italian-American, but the stuff is pretty dry and really adds no flavor.  It&apos;s essentially just a binder.  Here, the combination of the provolone melting into the sour cream is truly inspired; the sour cream adds moisture and the provolone adds flavor.  I&apos;m planning to use the same combo instead of ricotta in my next lasagna.  The importance of using a high-quality sauce for this recipe almost goes without saying, so I&apos;ll stop here.  Thanks, Colleen!"
5,"Rewrite of review - 
                                This was one of the first recipes I found on Allrecipes back in 2002.  Just made it again last night for friends (including 2 kids..who including the adults..went for seconds) and family.  This dish makes plenty of leftovers - pack them in tupperware and freeze for another night. Always a fantastic turnout with this dish!!
                                Did make a few altercations though...as always:
                                Didnt realize i picked up Penne pasta instead of Ziti at the store.  I omitted the onions. Used hot italian turkey sausage (squeezed the meat out of the casings and cooked it like you&apos;d cook ground beef).  Seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Mrs Dash.  Added 2 TBS of minced garlic to browning meat.  Added 1 (drained) can of mushroom pieces with stems.  Added 2 jars of pasta sauce and let simmer for 15 mins.  Halved the amount of (reduced fat/light) sour cream and replaced it with (reduced fat/light) ricotta.  And used the rest of the ingredients off the recipe.  Layered PAM sprayed Pyrex baking dishes like so...Ziti, sauce, Provolone, Sour Cream, Ricotta, ziti, rest of sauce and Sargento&apos;s Italian 6 Shredded Cheese Blend - Mozzarella, Provolone, Asiago and Parmesan.  Covered with foil and baked for 30 mins.  :) Yummmmy 
                                **TIP**
                                Unless you have a big family or are having company...i suggest if you are feeding up to 4 people to half the recipe. 
                                Thanks Colleen for a great recipe!"
5,"This is great! I use 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound Italian sausage and add onion, green pepper and garlic while browning. I add 1 TBSP of Italian seasoning, sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives to the sauce. I mix the pasta and meat sauce together, place half the mixture in the pan, then the sour cream and 1/2 of the cheese, then the remaining ziti mixture and top with the remaining cheese. I like the pasta completely coated with sauce. I use shredded Italian blend cheese and PILE it on, at least double what the recipe calls for, and increase the Parmesan as well. Definitely use 2 jars of sauce, it sounds like a lot but other wise the Ziti will be dry. This is perfect for a family gathering, it makes a lot."
5,"Delicious and great make-ahead recipe for entertaining.  Read a ton of the reviews and recommend following changes suggested by others: use larger dish (31/2-4 qt.), saute several cloves of minced garlic w/meat and onion, add layer of sauce over ziti before provolone/sour cream layer, cover while baking so it doesn&apos;t dry out, if making ahead and refrigerating, be sure to double the cooking time.  I used Bertolli Five Cheese spaghetti sauce with a little sugar and crushed red pepper -- excellent!  If"
5,"This was a really good recipe.  I wasn&apos;t able to find any sliced provolone cheese so I substituted it w/ a shredded cheese w/ provolone in it.  It still came out great, but it was difficult to spread the sour cream.  That was easily corrected by placing the sour cream in a zip lock bag, snipping a corner, and then evenly spreading it over the ingredients.  Everyone in my family loved it!"
4,"These were really good.  I made six small patties out of this.  I didn&apos;t use sherry, but thought that the taste was stil  excellent.  I did dip each of my patties in flour on both sides before putting them into the frying pan.  Finally, after I added my flour and beef broth to the onions, I added 1.5 cups of milk and let it come to a boil.  Then I mixed 2T of flour with 1/2 cup of milk and slowly poured it into the broth mix.  Once it was thickened, I returned the ""steaks"" to the gravy mixture.  They tasted wonderful like this!"
4,"I&apos;m always so nervous trying dishes without reviews!  But I just thought this sounded good.  And it IS good, so that was a relief.  I didn&apos;t have sherry, but I looked up a substitution chart and it said I could use orange juice or pineapple juice.  But I didn&apos;t have those either!  So I looked up aNOTHER chart and it told me I could use vanilla extract!  So I did (one tsp for the one tbsp sherry).  And the gravy just smelled so good.  And thickened up wonderfully.  All in all, a great, easy dish.  Just serve over rice!  :)"
5,"After we travel, Hubs and I crave an old-fashioned, comfort food dinner. I was on a plane at 37,000 ft. when I came across this recipe and couldn’t wait to get home to make it. I agree with Lisa completely, that this is reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV dinner, those with the aluminum trays, designed before the advent of microwave ovens. When I was a young girl, I remember a rare treat was to accompany Mom to the grocery store and choose a TV dinner. My favorite was Salisbury steak with mashed potatoes and corn (the deluxe version included a really awful brownie). This is what we craved, and this is what I attempted to recreate tonight with this recipe. In other words, I had no illusions that it would taste like anything else, and I was not disappointed. In keeping with that memory, I used cornstarch rather than flour for the gravy, as I remember those TV dinners having a translucent gravy. I cooked the heck out of the onions, until they were nearly caramelized - sweet, soft and so good. I cooked them separately, removed them from the pan, then fried up the hamburger patties. I tried making 8 of them as the recipe directed, but that was just too skimpy for me, so I made 6. I seasoned them following the recipe exactly – I wanted these simple, the kind of meal I recall growing up – nothing fancy, just delicious and satisfying. Since I served this with mashed potatoes (and corn of course!) I doubled the gravy (with no salt) and was pleased I did. We cleaned our plates."
5,"This doesn&apos;t apply to this recipe specifically, but I am sick and tired of reading bad reviews from people who haven&apos;t even tried the recipe.  Every cook tweaks a recipe a bit, but to give it a bad review?  Too much time on their hands.  Let&apos;s see some of THEIR recipes!"
5,"this recipe is excellent as is.  Please, people....review the recipe as it is, and rate it as it is!!  Adding or changing the ingredients alters the recipe, and therefore is not a true rating of the original recipe."
5,"We loved this recipe, thanks! I used French Onion soup instead of the beef broth, and would highly recommend using ground Angus for the beef. The flavor is wonderful, thanks!"
3,"Good recipe, but using fresh herbs and spices really helps...fresh grated garlic, minced onions or grated onion, fresh cracked pepper etc. really makes a big difference...a little chopped parsley also adds something."
5,"This was VERY yummy!!!  As always, I made the recipe EXACTLY as it is and I have to say I owuldn&apos;t change a thing."
5,These were great! I decided to follow another user&apos;s directions and add a splash of red wine vinegar (in place of the sherry that I didn&apos;t have) and it pretty much ruined the gravy beyond belief. Don&apos;t use vinegar! I luckily had an instant brown gravy mix that I whipped up last minute. Thank God you have to remove the meat or else it would have been ruined too! The way I saved it was great and I ate it on top of white rice.
4,"I made this for my husband and myself last night, because the snow we got on the weekend put me in a ""comfort-food"" mood. Like others, I added extra seasonings to suit our tastes. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and the onions with the meat, and added three crushed garlic cloves and a tablespoon of Minor&apos;s beef broth concentrate. I also covered the casserole for the first hour, which kept it nice and moist and helped the potatoes cook properly. I then removed the lid for 15 minutes, which helped set up the dish nicely. Last, I didn&apos;t add any cheese at all, and didn&apos;t miss it. I felt that cheese would only make it greasy and heavier than I would have been able to stand. Granted, it&apos;s not gourmet, but it was created with kids in mind, after all. It was definitely something I&apos;ll make again when I feel like comfort food."
5,"This was so good and much easier than shepherds pie- and with alot less mess. I did add a layer of green beans and added a few more seasonings to the meat as it cooked. I used some garlic, basil and paprika which made it flavourful.  It was a big hit with my family and i will certainly make it again."
5,"Wow!  A recipe from ""yesteryear.""  Add some baby carrots and you have what we used to call ""College Casserole"" - for obvious reasons -  you can increase the recipe and feed all your hungry classmates.  Also after graduation, you can fix this and feel all your friends who are still looking for jobs - inexpensive and very good!  Thanks so much for sharing this.  I had forgotten the recipe."
3,"If this recipe had had more seasonings listed, I definitely would have give it four stars, however, as written, it would have been very, very bland; at least for our taste. I added garlic and onion powders, a half of an envelope of dried onion soup mix, a small can of mild green chilies and a pinch of cayenne. We thought it was really good and I&apos;ll definitely make this again. Thank you!"
4,"I prepared this recipe as written, added a can of creamed corn, and layered the ingrdeients in a crockpot.  It cooked on LOW all afternoon and was delicious, no fuss, & didn&apos;t heat up my already warm house."
5,"This was 5 star with some modifications suggested by others.  Needed some seasoning. Here are the changes:
                                1. Brown meat with onion and garlic.
                                2. Add minced garlic and beef broth concentrate to the liquid. If you don&apos;t have the concentrate, just use some powdered gravy mix, or something similar to jazz up.
                                3. I used beefy mushroom soup.
                                4. Here is the biggest tip:  Microwave the potatoes (thinly cut) for 8 minutes on high before putting into casserole. This will lessen your cooking time considerably.  Mine was done in 1 hr 10 minutes. Cook first 55 minutes with foil on, last 15 uncovered.
                                
                                Awesome comfort food."
5,"Hubby says this one is a keeper! I used cream of celery, 1 can mushrooms, small can of green chilies, garlic salt, parsley flakes, and added grated monterey jack to the sauce. I covered it but I think it you would just end up with sauce as last layer, it would dry out a little more. I put cheddar cheese on last 15 minutes, let it rest for 15 minutes out of the oven to set up. Easy and adapts well to what I had on hand!"
5,"This was a great casserole.  My husband said, ""this is really delicious"" after all three helpings.  I added some sour cream to the soup & milk which gave it a richer flavor.  I forgot to add salt & pepper but we didn&apos;t even miss it.  I baked it for 1 1/2 hours and the potatoes were perfect."
4,"This turned out a lot better than other ""poor-man"" style hamburger casseroles I&apos;ve tried. I added some garlic powder to the soup mixture to liven it up a bit, but I was overzealous and overspiced it, so I thinned it out with some extra milk and a heaping tablespoon of mayonnaise, which worked well, as there was a perfect amount of sauce. I also added about 3/4 cup each of sliced carrot and celery to the sauce. I probably put more than the recomended amount of cheese on, too; I did&apos;t measure. Another thing was the recipe didn&apos;t specify whether or not to cover; it&apos;s definately one to cover! This will go on my recipe rotation."
5,looked at this and some things missing .... use a onion and 5 cloves of garlic  blend them up to a paste.  Add a pound of ground pork  and use parmesan reggiano   If the onion will not blend add some stock till in does.. you can put the spices onion and garlic a little fry in olive oil brfore blendin if you feel like cleaning another pan no water in meatballs the onion and garlic add the moisture
5,"AMAZING!  
                                * Substituted 1 Tbs Oregano for Parsley
                                * Substituted 1 cup fresh mozzarella pearls & got that melted goodness inside"
5,Turned out very good.
5,"My teenager and I loved these meatballs! I used dried parsley in place of fresh and added some pork as other reviewers have suggested. The Italian bread crumbs and spices add a nice flavor, plus I splurged on fresh Romano, yum. Bonus for us is no ""icky bits""--i.e., little pieces of onion or pepper that my son&apos;s persnickety palate rejects. We didn&apos;t even add sauce or manage to get them onto rolls for sandwiches, just ate them straight from the oven. 10/10 will make again!"
5,Great flavor ...these are excellent and so easy to make.  This recipe will be my  go to for meatballs.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!!!
5,Turned out pretty well. Easy recipe with great flavor
5,I Didn’t use eggs or water.... I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and they were really good. I’ve made meatballs way “fancier”and my family loves these they can eat them without any sauce.
5,"This was awesome with a few tweaks. I added 1 heaping teaspoon each of salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. I just eyeballed a big shake of black pepper in. Also, used panko instead of seasoned breadcrumbs."
5,"these were great. I had to more then double it because i have 5 children and they eat a lot, but they loved them, I will be making more of these thank you for sharing your recipe."
5,"If there was a section for Comments, I would leave this message there because this is for the reviewer that gave it one star and commented that it was not really goulash.  Well, it may not be goulash to you but there are thousands of us who grew up eating this and it was called goulash.  It is an easy, filling, economical, tasty dish so keep your reviews to the recipe and not the name, you may not know what you are talking about.  I noticed you did the same thing to a mexican dish;  you said it was not authentic.  This is a site to share recipes and report how it worked for us."
4,"This is the classic goulash made in the mid-west, USA, not Hungarian Goulash. I grew up on this in Iowa, but we used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, no bay leaf, and a green pepper if we had one."
5,"This is not ""classic"" Hungarian Goulash but it is goulash or Chop Suey depending on what part of the country you grew up. For me it was western NY and we added canned corn. Made this tonight, exactly as written, for my very picky folks and we loved it; it was a taste of my childhood. Next time I&apos;ll add Jalapeno and bell peppers."
5,"This one is classic AMERICAN style goulash.  The picture depicts it.  This is a dish that was mainstay for most of us and even served at school.   @Pathunt:  Nicely done!  I made it just as the recipe states and enjoyed it but next time around I will add a diced green pepper to the meat as it&apos;s browning and probably a shake of garlic powder to remind me of school, and LOTS of fresh ground pepper."
4,"I&apos;m grateful for this recipe because it reminds me of a dish my mother made in the mid-1940&apos;s in Denmark after the war when we finally could get enough cheap meat with our ration coupons to do it.  This recipe has nothing whatever to do with anything I think of as goulash, whether Hungarian, Austrian, German or even Danish, but it was a way to use ground meat for something other than meat balls.  My mother&apos;s concoction was called Red Indian Hash because of the colors added by vegetables (nothing to do with Native Americans either!), and everybody loved it, served not with macaroni in it, but with mashed potatoes on the side to absorb the lovely gravy.  She grated carrots and turnips and any other root vegetable she had and cooked them along with the chopped onions. She might add a few beans or peas as well. Any ground meat was fine - beef, veal, pork, mutton - whatever we were lucky enough to have.  Canned tomatoes did not exist then, so she had to moisten the mix with stock (usually vegetable stock with an addition of yeast extract - no soy sauce then) and chop a tomato or two if she could spare them.  With everything available to us now, just think what we could do with a pound of ground meat, matching veggie flavors and herbs and aromatics to the type of meat.  Thanks for reminding me of what can be done! and of how rich we are now. . ."
4,"Because we&apos;re on a super tight budget this week, I used only one pound ground meat (half ground beef, half ground pork) and threw in chopped veggies for the rest of the meat (red pepper, zucchini, spinach). To make a more tomato-y sauce, I used V-8 instead of water. I&apos;m out of soy sauce so I used worchestershire instead of soy sauce. I did not need the seasoning salt--we&apos;re watching our salt intake--and I also used organic canned tomato sauce, organic canned tomatoes and homemade italian seasoning. Very economical and a good way for me to bend the recipe to add more healthy ingredients for my family nevermind it filled the bellies of my three hungry men very well. There&apos;s plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow as well, which I appreciate."
5,"This is delicious! It is near identical to a Paula Deen goulash recipe that I have been making for a few years. It is also easy to make as the noodles are added uncooked. The main difference it appears between this and that recipe of hers, that I use, is it looks like the ingredients here are doubled, so this recipe here will feed a lot! And, this recipe here uses tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and that one uses an equal amount of crushed tomatoes. Either way, Mid-western style goulash is a favorite in my home!"
5,"Being from Minnesota, I understood the term ""goulash"" as meaning ""hot dish"" as the two terms are more or less interchangable in this state! I realize there is a Hungarian goulash which is completely different, but this is a regional term that I understood to be exactly what it is! Kudos! Yummy"
5,"mrsjoedo mentioned something was missing, next time try adding chopped green pepper. To me it&apos;s not goulash unless you add it."
3,"Too soupy, too much bay. Was ok but wont make again."
4,"Very good. Indeed, the amount of cheese mixture is WAY too much for this recipe. I used 1 15-oz. containter of ricotta with same amount of eggs, mozzarella, parm, and replacing dried parsley with about 4 tbs fresh, and I replaced the 1/2 c. water with 1/4 c. water and 1/4 c. red wine. Very rich and tasty. However, a word to the wise: I unwisely chose to use 1/2 lb. lean ground beef with 1/2 lb. sausage. I think this would be a good decision if.. and I do mean ONLY IF... you have access to good spicy Italian-style sausage. Do not use ""country"" sausage or any sausage with a sweet base. Our local store had sausage, but it&apos;s flavored with sage and maple. Good with eggs. Bad with lasagne. Other than that, very simple, comparatively quick, little mess and rather tasty. I would, in the future, try it with a little garlic, some fresh basil, a dash of oregano, and maybe some cooked shrooms added in. I wouldn&apos;t use fresh shrooms, as it may make the dish too squishy and cause it to not ""stand up"" as a lasagne should. Definitnely worth a try with some tweaking."
4,My husbands absolute favorite thing to eat is lasagna and I&apos;ve been looking for an easy to make lasagna recipe- paticularly one where I didn&apos;t have to boil the noodles and one I could use store bought sauce. He&apos;s a pretty tough lasagna critic and he liked it alot. This was so easy to make and I&apos;m glad I finally found an easy recipe to satisfy my husband&apos;s lasagna needs. The only change I made to the recipe was using ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese- it turned out great!
5,"This recipe saved the day when I had 5 college kids drop by for dinner unexpectedly.  I used the ""no-boil"" lasagna noodles, mild Italian sausage instead of hamburg, and 60 ounces of spaghetti sauce, leaving out the water.  I also layered in some fresh baby spinach leaves.  It was a big hit!!  Thanks!!"
5,"This recipe was a fantastic starting point!  My husband as of late has been a very picky eater had two servings!!!  When browning the ground beef I added some lawrys seasoning salt, freash onion, 2 freash chopped cloves of garlic, some parsley, oregano, garlic powder, and some italian seasonsing, then with making the sauce, I added minced seasoned tomatoes, seasoned with garlic and oregano.  I drained most of the juices from it, not all, I added the sauce, and added about a quarter cup of water to it.  Then for the cheese mixture I changed out the cottage cheese for riccotta cheese, and since I am a cheese freak I added a bit extra for good measure. It turned out fabulous!  I didn&apos;t know that you didnt have to cook the noodles, and I was a bit skeptic, but Thank you so much for showing me the way it should be done.  Oh and with other comments to it being soupy, i still added a bout a quarter of a cup of water to the edges of it, but for the last 10 minutes while it was covered i turned the heat up to 400 degrees, and then when i took the foil off, i only put it in for ten minutes at 375, just to be safe.  I served immediately and it was great.  I  am so thankful for this recipe, it was a wonderful romantic dinner!!!!Thanks!"
5,"The easiest and best tasting lasagna I&apos;ve made, including authentic Italian recipes that take twice as long.  This takes 30 minutes to prepare, only because I add mushrooms and onions to the meat.  I scale it down for a 9X9 pan.  The amount of cottage cheese is too much - I used 12 oz. for a 9X9.  I still used 2 eggs, 8 oz (2 cups) of mozzarella and used lasagna sheets.  The sheets are slightly thinner than regular lasagna noodles and fit perfectly in a 9X9.  
                                Allow a full hour for baking.  Although it looked soupy when I took it out of the oven, after 10 minutes it was fine.  I used regular (not no bake)lasagna noodles and Ragu."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe but I recommend adding about 50% more spaghetti sauce because otherwise it&apos;s a little dry. With that suggestion it is the perfect lasagna!
5,I am a novice cook and I have always wanted to make lasagna. This recipe was perfect it was so easy and it was delicious! It made me look like an expert thank you! I substituted some of the mozzarella with cheddar it was so cheesy! And I was so impressed with the way the noodles came out even after not being cooked first excellent recipe!
5,"This is the tastiest ""Fast"" recipe for lasagna I have found. My family loves it and since my husband is a garlic fanatic I mince two cloves of garlic into the hamburger when it fries. Its an easy way to enhance the flavor."
4,This lasagna was great! I was looking for an easy lasagna recipe and I&apos;ve found it. I did use more spaghetti sauce than the recipe called for.
3,It&apos;s quick to fix but the flavor was not the best.
5,"This is your basic recipe for stuffed cabbage that always brings me compliments. I bake this recipe in the oven rather than cooking it stove top. I line my pan with the larger cabbage leaves. I also cover the cabbage rolls wtih additional leaves. This way the actual cabbage rolls stay moist and don&apos;t get burned. I do parboil my cabbage, cutting a few leaves off at a time as they cook. I do add 1/2 to 3/4 cup tomato juice to the meat. This is something my Polish mother always did. I do make a different sauce. After all the work of making homemade stuffed cabbage rolls, I find it hard to pour tomato soup on top. For one pound of meat, I mix an 8oz. can of tomato sauce, 1 Tablespoon brown sugar, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice and 1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce. I mix well and pour over cabbage rolls. Sometimes I double the sauce if I want a lot extra. I often serve these with noodles, so it is nice to have plenty of sauce to pour on the noodles."
4,"Because I always read the hint to freeze the cabbage head and the leaves fall right off, I wanted to add my hint too.  I have done both, freeze the cabbage head and boil the cabbage leaves.  My advice is to ONLY freeze the cabbage leaves if you&apos;re short on time or you won&apos;t eat the cabbage leaves anyway.  This is an old world recipe, a classic and you don&apos;t mess with the classics if you don&apos;t have to.  By boiling the leaves, your cabbage rolls will turn out tender and edible.  By freezing them, they tend to be rubbery and inedible.  Just a warning to those who might not want to follow this recipe as directed.  It might be a little disappointing to the texture of the finished cabbbage roll."
4,"An easy way to separate the cabbage is to take off the outer leaves making it a manageable size.  Bring a large pot of water to boil then putting the whole cabbage in the water.  Watch how much water you have in the pot because the cabbage will raise the level quite a bit.  Parboil for about 5 or 6 minutes, drain the water & place the cabbage in cold water to stop the cooking.  The leaves come off very well and are pliable to work with.  Hope this helps."
5,"I&apos;m quite certain this recipe would have been great exactly as written, but I did make a few changes to suit our taste. First of all, you can get your cabbage leaves to come apart perfectly by zapping the head of cabbage in the microwave for about 2-1/2 minutes at a time. Just score the core, and you will get full, perfect leaves without any tearing at all. No need to mess with boiling water.
                                I did not cook the cabbage leaves at all, I just simmered the rolls longer in step 4. With the meatballs, I added an entire cup of rice, garlic powder and closer to 1/4 cup of the prepared sauce. I did not find any reason to secure the cabbage rolls with toothpicks or string; they stayed together just fine seam side down. Being out of tomato soup, I used tomato sauce, but more of it; 3 (8 oz.) cans plus 1/2 cup of water. I also upped the brown sugar and lemon juice to 2 Tbsp. each. I remember my grandma making these when I was a child, and she would always throw  a handful of gingersnaps into her sauce, so I added 4-5 to mine for good measure.
                                Simmered for about an hour, stirring and basting as directed. This was my first attempt at making these, and they were out of this world. Thanks for the post, Judy... I&apos;ll be sharing it with my cooking pals at ourtabletalk.com"
5,"This was my first time making stuffed cabbage and I must say, it exceeded my expectations!  For starters, I boiled the whole cabbage head in salted water for 6 minutes and found it very easy to work with. Like others, I added garlic, 1 tbs. of worchestshire sauce, 1 tbs. of lemon juice and 1 tbs. of brown sugar to the meat mixture. I also added onion soup mix to the meat mixture, talk about great flavor. This will be a regular meal in our home, what a hit!!"
5,very good! I added some garlic and basil for extra seasoning. I also used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato soup. It was my first time making cabbage rolls and they turned out great! thanks!
5,"I made this for dinner tonight.  It certainly was a hit.  I did use spaghetti sauce instead of soup, and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 1 hour.  Thanks for the recipe:)"
3,This recipe was good but I changed it a little. Instead of tomato soup I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. We love more of a saucier version.
5,My Polish wife loved this recipe! I added more tomato sauce than called for and it turned out great.
5,"YUMMY!!! This recipe was great. I made some modifications based on the ingredients I happened to have on hand, and it still turned out great. Used 1.5 lbs ground beef (since it was packaged that way), 1.5 cups salsa since that was all I had, black beans instead of chili beans for a little added mexican flare, 2 cups crused tortillas, no olives (can&apos;t stand em), and 1 can diced tomatoes, drained. GREAT TURN OUT!!! A few things, though... I agree with another reviewer that 3 cups is definitely too much for the tortilla chips. The 2 cups I used was too much. I&apos;ll only use about 1.5 cups next time. Also, my diced tomatoes were canned with basil and garlic, and I didn&apos;t care much for the flavor with this casserole (although it was mild enough that I still gobbled it up), so I&apos;ll remember to have just some regular diced tomatoes on hand from now on. And, if you like green onion, don&apos;t skimp on it here. The flavor really goes well in this dish; I mean, out of this world. MMMMM... Of course, as others suggested, I browned the ground beef with onion and taco seasoning (I added this WHILE the meat browned, not after, but either way would probably work fine). As always, I used all organic ingredients and followed the layering just as specified in the recipe. This dish is a knockout! Thanks so much for sharing it."
5,"We thought this recipe was awesome!  I did do as many others and added a packet of taco seasoning to the meat.  I also added a little garlic powder, black pepper, and cayenne-southern people love there seasonings!!  I used bite-size totrilla chips and they worked out prefectly.  This recipe is definitely going to be a repeat!"
4,"I changed this up a bit to try to make it healthier.  I used corn tortillas on the bottom instead of torilla chips, and layered the ingredients in 2 layers, like a lasanga, hoping it would hold together better.  I used one layer of corn and another of flour torillas.  I used a blend of cheese (""mexican style"") and low fat sour cream, added an additional can of chili beans, and used ground turkey instead of beef.  I also added a green pepper, an onion and green chilis and some more spices, as many reviewers said it was bland.  It wasn&apos;t spicy at all so next time I&apos;ll add more to it.  It still was pretty tasty and a hearty meal with a nice salad."
5,"This was fantastic. I normally would have used refried beans with a dish like this, but the chili beans were perfect! They added just the right flavor to it. Our whole family loved this recipe. We will definitely be eating it again. I don&apos;t think I will crush the chips next time though. Instead I&apos;m going to try leaving the chips whole. Some of the chips were a little tender, and we all prefer crispy things to stay crispy. We still loved it though just as it is."
5,"WOW! I doubled the recipe so I could experiment and the results were incredible! Changes from original recipe include: 1. Used 1/2 ground beef, 1/2 sweet saugage, casing removed. 2. Used chipotle taco seasoning. 3. Used chili and black beans. 4. Used 1 can of diced tomatoes, salt free, and 1 can of Rotel. 5. Mixed cheddar with salsa jack cheese. 6. Added garlic and onion powder. 7. Forgot the black olives. This meal was so delicious. As others have mentioned, not the healthiest option, but for a pot luck or get together where it will be one of many choices, it can&apos;t be beat!"
4,"This was mui bueno! I added green chilies, seasoned (drained) black beans, taco seasoning, Emeril&apos;s Southwest Essence, (drained) Mexicorn and a can of Rotel.  Did not use the sour cream but I did layer the ingredients using split white corn taco shells.  Seemed a bit soggy so next time I&apos;ll double the thickness of the taco shells.  Nice paired with a salad tossed with southwestern ranch dressing.  A good recipe to customize to your own taste. I just love these recipes where canned products end up being used so creatively you can&apos;t tell they&apos;re canned."
5,"This was excellent.  I did change a couple of things.  Added garlic, used black beans instead of chili beans, added corn and chopped canned chilies.  I also mixed monterrey jack in with the cheddar.  The salsa I used was Joe T. Garcia&apos;s, medium.  My fiance loved this recipe and gave me the line, ""It&apos;s a keeper!""  The wonderful thing about this recipe is you can add anything.  Want it hot, add hot salsa."
5,"Not only is this an easy dish, it is also VERY good. Per other reviews, I used taco seasoning on the meat after it was browned.  I also reduced the sour cream to 1 1/2 cups and spread it thin over the meat (my boyfriend is not the biggest sour cream fan) and sprinkled appx 1 cup crushed chese flavored nacho chips (ie: doritos) before topping it all off with cheese. Very tasty! We have no leftovers! Thanks Andrea!"
5,"Easy and something different for a mexican meal.  I did as others and used taco seasoning and black beans with the ground beef.  In addition, I used Rotel tomatoes with green chilies and Mexicorn on top of the sour cream."
3,"Had the students in my survival cooking class make this recipe.  Most of them enjoyed it.  I thought the tortilla chips, which lined the bottom, tasted too dry.  Would probably add more ground beef also."
5,"Made this last night with the following adjustments: browned the beef with the taco seasoning to give it more flavor, used a 10.75 oz. can of tomato soup instead of the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, added a packet of ranch dressing, only used 1 can of beans, used 1 can of ""southwestern style"" diced tomatoes (diced tomatoes and jalapenos) and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes, and only added 1 cup of water. It was perfect  -- had a great consistency (not too thick, not too runny) and was spicy but not too hot. Definitely add a dollop of sour cream! Delicious!"
5,"Best taco soup I&apos;ve ever made!  I made it a day early and took it to an office lunch (oh, was much better the second day), and it got raves.  I did make a few small changes to the recipe, but nothing substantive...I browned the ground beef with chopped onion and garlic.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that had jalapeno peppers mixed in, instead of a separate can of chili peppers.  Omitted the water and added a second can of tomato sauce, and substituted black beans for kidney beans.  The final addition...was a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, instead of the corn water.  As I said, it got raves, and this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Janeen!"
4,"This recipe is a good base but I felt it needed some spicing up.  I sauted the onions and about a teaspoon of garlic with the meat.  I also added the dressing and the taco seasoning to the meat before adding to the crock pot.  I tasted the mix before adding water and felt it was too bland, so I added extra cumin and chili powder and a bottle of Mexican beer rather than water.  I think the beer really made a big difference.  I also served with cheese, sour cream, onions, and cheddar-jalepeno beer bread.  I will probably make this again as it was a good start to the chili."
5,"What an awesome, simple recipe!!  It can cook well over 8 hours, too.  I made mine with ground turkey and the beef was never missed!  Thanks for the recipe!"
5,Five stars because this is very easy really tasty super economical can feed a crowd and makes great leftovers. By the time all the ingredients were added my 4-quart crockpot was completely full. This is a HUGE amount of food! All I had on hand was chicken taco spices but it worked just fine (with a little extra salt & pepper while browning the hamburger). We topped ours with shredded Colby-Jack and lite sour cream and warmed our tortilla chips on a cookie sheet at 350 for 3-4 minutes for extra crunch and flavor. YUM!!
5,"Excellent and Easy!  I added a package of Ranch Dip mix as well.  Once meat was brown, sprinkled a bit of the taco mix & ranch mix in to flavor the meat some.  Left out the corn and didn&apos;t miss it.  But added a small can of diced jalapeno peppers as well as the green chili peppers (they really have no heat to them!) and it was rather spicy.  Might suggest 1/3 to 1/2 can of jalapenos for the tentative!  Used black beans also...very good!  Cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips a must have!!"
4,This is a nice recipe for the winter! I like to use black beans instead of chili beans and ground turkey instead of beef. Yummy!
3,This tasted just like chili and nothing like tacos.  I won&apos;t be making this one again.  My husband is not a chili lover for some reason.
4,Soup was very good. I also added the ranch dressing packet. I added too many green chiles and the family thought it was a little too spicy but very tasty.
5,"Great recipe!  My go to..why people have to be so rude is beyond me..IT IS Chili..Chili is made differently all over the country, and liked many different ways..if you don&apos;t like ""Wendy"" style Chili,  why on Earth make the recipe and then leave a bad review?"
5,"Excellent recipe!  Going to make it again and again.  Chili is very diverse and everyone has there taste preference when it comes to chili.  If you do not like the flavor of Wendys chili do not make this recipe thinking it&apos;s going to be different.  And please do not offer your comments and rating.  I rated this recipe based on the fact that I love Wendys chili and how close does this chili come to that flavor.  Very close and the flavor perfect.... Is it Wendys? NO, you only get Wendys chili at Wendys!  Is it a good rendition.. Oh yes..... And it&apos;s even better on day 2!!!!  If you choose to review a recipe make sure you made the recipe as posted.  Do not review a recipe if you changed it all up and then don&apos;t like.  A less than 4 or 5 star review of a changed up recipe is a review of ones own poor cooking skills.  Be real!!!"
5,"My entire family LOVED this chili and they never agree on anything.  
                                
                                I didn&apos;t have the packets of chili seasoning so I used 1 rounded Tbs Cumin, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 1 1/4 Tbs Chili Powder, 1 tsp Oregano, 1 tsp basil.  
                                
                                This will be my go to chili."
5,"My 9yo, 7yo, and 5yo made supper for their grandparents last night.  They decided to cook chili but it couldn&apos;t be too spicy for their grandparents.  We selected this recipe and they cooked it with minimal support from me.  Everyone enjoyed the chili and it did remind me of Wendy&apos;s chili (It would have been an almost perfect match if the kids had cut up the stewed tomatoes but they missed that step.)  When we cuddled in bed last night, my 7yo son asked that I write a good review for this recipe.  We will make it again."
5,Made it last night and it turned out SUPERB and just like Wendy&apos;s!!!  Will mark it as a favorite Recipe!
5,"Great, as written but easily tweaked to your preferences. To the person who said it isn&apos;t chili, look beyond that and rate it for great flavor. Over 90 percent of the reviews are excellent, maybe the southwest should lay off the hot sauce and try tasting food again."
5,"I can&apos;t tell you how many chili recipes I&apos;ve tried in the past.  This is hands-down my favorite and will definitely be part of the ""regular"" meal planning rotation.  Perfect for my busy-wife-and-mommy life!  Great for the slow cooker - I browned the ground beef for about 8 or so minutes on the stove and dumped everything into the pot w/out sautéing anything else - super easy!  Freezes perfectly, tastes even better the next day, feeds a crowd for company and potlucks.  The only thing I&apos;d suggest is to rinse your beans.  The frothy stuff you see when rinsing is what causes the ""musical"" part to your postprandial experience so rinsing definitely cuts that down if it&apos;s ever been a concern for you.  My husband likes his spicy so he will be adding more chili powder and cumin to his helping; if you like spicier chili you will need to do the same as the way it is written here gives you a mild, ever-so-slight kick.  Or, when you purchase the chili seasonings packets, pick ""medium"" or ""hot"" (I chose the 30% less sodium, mild spice option).  Love that it&apos;s also way more economical than running to the local food chain when I have a hankerin&apos; for some of that famous chili =)"
5,"Made this recipe tonight. Customized it a bit by seasoning the ground meat before cooking, used Mexican Style stewed tomatoes, HOT McCormick Chili Seasoning, and RO*TEL with habanero for extra spice. Was delicious and will definitely make this recipe again."
5,"Super good chili!!  My 7 year old didn&apos;t believe I made it...he thought it was Wendy&apos;s chili!  I did not have chili seasoning packets, so I used the approximate following measurements of spices: 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp salt, 2 1/2 TBS chili powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I also substituted 1 of the cans of stewed tomatoes for petite diced tomatoes and I blended the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes I did use in a blender first....scared my kids wouldn&apos;t like it if it was too chunky.  LOVE THIS RECIPE - THANKS FOR SHARING!!!"
1,OMG! this is not chili.........not sure what it is but it tastes like sweet celery and chili soup. It might do for hot dog sauce or possibly sloppy joes but don&apos;t try to pass this off as chili anywhere in the southwest Update: this recipe cannot be saved......just not chili in any way shape or form. Sorry
4,People if your not going to make the recipe as written then don&apos;t review it send in your altered recipe and let us review it.
4,"I liked the idea of this. But I did change it a bit. Instead of using spaghetti sauce from a jar, I made my own with meat. I also used both Parmesan and Romano cheeses because that&apos;s what my husband likes. Instead of cottage cheese I used ricotta cheese. I didn&apos;t see the point of using eggs at all so I skipped them.  I liked that it was baked. It really brings out the flavor throughout the entire dish."
5,"I am still trying to figure out why people rate a recipe they haven&apos;t tried or have tried and rate it low when they change the recipe.  That is considered a new recipe, which they should submit.  This is delicious as is.  It freezes well and is a great dish to use when cooking for others who can keep it frozen until they want to use it."
4,I used the ricotta cheese based on pooter61&apos;s recommendation and this turned out deliciously.
5,"Great, simple recipe. Used with whole wheat pasta. The addition of the egg mixture made the noodles extra rich. Will use again."
5,"I think the picture just doesn&apos;t do this recipe justice. I found this recipe the same day I was having family over and desperately searching for a quick, easy recipe. This recipe was perfect. I had a tough crowd and they&apos;re pretty opinionated, but everyone LOVED it!!! It was truly delicious. I did make a few minor adjustments. I added 1/4 cup of italian parsley (regular parsley would be great too). I used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce (the other 1/2 can be used later for a toasted ravioli dinner). And instead of 4 cups mozzarella, I did 2 cups mozzarella and 2 cups italian blend. Based on the picture in this recipe, I was concerned there may be too much cheese and it may taste or look greasy. Not at all. Try it for yourself! :-)
                                
                                Oh - and I don&apos;t like cottage cheese myself, but I DID keep it in the recipe. I couldn&apos;t taste it and I think it&apos;s important to keep in the recipe."
2,"I would like to try to make this again. I didn&apos;t have any cottage cheese, but I did have ricotta so I used that instead (just as I would in lasagna), but my family and I just did not enjoy this. An entire pound of spaghetti noodles was too much, and there wasn&apos;t enough of the meat sauce to suit our tastes, so it just seemed like we were eating noodles baked with lots of cheese and a little bit of meat sauce. It didn&apos;t have much flavor. Next time I will definitely try it with the cottage cheese, but I think I will also decrease the amount of noodles and add a little extra sauce."
5,"The first time I had this I fell in love with it. I could not get the recipe from the person who made it. Now, a year later, I found this recipe and LOVE it!!! My family loves it too. It certainly isn&apos;t health food but it takes the crown for comfort food."
5,"It is delicious. The eggs, cheese and butter with the noodles is a must do, really ups the ante on the whole recipe. ""I didn&apos;t see the point of using eggs at all"" totally jacks up the recipe...do it as written, it is splendid."
5,"Nothing annoys me more than someone posting a review when they didn&apos;t follow the recipe as written... and now someone posting a 1-star review who didn&apos;t even TRY it.  Use some common sense people!!!  This is delicious as written.  If you choose to spice it up or alter it somehow, that&apos;s your choice but shouldn&apos;t be a criticism of the recipe."
4,I saw this recipe on Facebook and now I see it here. I tried it today and added 3/4 cups brown rice and 1 1/2 cups more water. I used spicy diced tomatoes. I cooked it on top of the stove for about 1 1/2 hours on a simmer. It turned out so delicious. I serve it with sour cream on the side. I love cabbage rolls and this is a reasonable facsimile. There will be leftovers for lunches. Yum!
4,"This was a very good recipe. However, I made a couple of adjustments. I wanted rice, so I added 1/2 cup of instant rice and added 1 cup of liquid. I try to use beef or chicken broth instead of water in most recipes, so I substituted beef broth in this case. My husband said it was better than rolled cabbage rolls. I agree, and I think the flavors blended better this way. I may never roll cabbage again."
5,I&apos;ve been making this recipe for over 40+ years and there are so many variations. I&apos;ve never had an actually recipe.  I just throw ingredients in the pot. I&apos;ve made it with ground turkey or chicken. I&apos;ve omitted ground meats and added kielbasa and have also made it with sweet sausage.  Always add garlic. Added rice or chopped or slice potato. Normally add a teaspoon or 2 of sugar.  This is a great basic recipe play with the ingredients and spices.  No matter what you add or not it&apos;s always satisfying. Kraft recipes also has a version of it also.  Thanks for sharing.
5,"Unstuffed cabbage roll, genius.  I tried this recipe, and it essentially mimics any cabbage roll filling.  Don&apos;t put Campbell&apos;s soup in this.  Instead, take a can of tomato paste and add water to your liking to taste.  Tomato paste is tangy and can be regulated with your personal salt content. Campbell&apos;s soup is salt in a can.  I bought two cans of tomato paste in case I needed a tomato flavor. It&apos;s cheap, and does not taste like soup, you are putting into, well, soup.  I surfed the web and found a lot of people use brown sugar, vinegar, or lemon in the recipe.  The vinegar and lemon would be used to cut the cabbage bitterness... and sugar... to mimic American-Italian sauces?  They contain a lot of sugar, by the way.  I did add a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  BUT THAT&apos;S IT.  Turned out awesome.  I freezed half of it for later. Everyone loved it."
3,"For more flavor, I replace the plain tomato sauce with Campbell&apos;s Tomato Soup."
5,Only thing I changed was I added 1 cup of water and 1 cup of rice. This tastes just like Halupki&apos;s without the mess of boiling the cabbage and wrapping with meat and rice.
4,"My family enjoys this recipe, but I add about 1/8 cup of vinegar & 1 tbsp of sugar to give it the flavor of the stuffed cabbage they love!  Healthy, easy & delicious!!"
4,"Excellent dish, does need more spice...added additional salt & pepper, along with some brown sugar.  Cooked about a 1/2 hour longer than stated, to let flavors blend and to soften the cabbage a little more.  Served on a bed of rice."
5,"This was DELICIOUS!!!! Meatballs were super tender spices were perfect, nice and savory. Gravy was very good (I&apos;m going to try less sour cream next time but I like a meatier gravy) I made the gravy with the dripping like it called for but I used the pan I fried meatballs in earlier which had even more drippy goodness in it. I served the meatballs over rice but I might try noodles sometime. A word of caution, try to pace yourself while eating these it&apos;s easy to inhale a couple dozen and these deserve to be savored!"
5,This dish was perfect. I wanted to try it as my grandmother used to make Swedeish Meatballs at Christmas times as well. The flavor is perfect and the gravy outstanding. Thank you for helping me create the same memories with my children. Thank you for sharing the recipe. The entire family loved it and my children will usally avoid anything with onions. They went back for seconds on this fabulous dish.
5,"This is oh so good. I did a search online for the Swedish Name version. Tried some. This is by far the tastiest! After everything was done, I put in slow cooker on warm. Added noodles way al dente. When we were ready to eat, every taste blended wonderfully."
5,"I usually hate it when when people rate recipes that they don&apos;t follow, but I&apos;m guilty this time.  I skipped the meatballs and used beef stew meat.  Browned it off and threw it in the crockpot with all of your spices (including the optionals).  When the meat was tender, I thickend the sauce, added the sour cream and served over fresh pasta. Absolutely delicious!  I guess my version could be called Swedish stroganoff?  Very good recipe.  I will make the meat balls next time to honor your family tradition."
5,"Definitely 5 stars!!!  I was hesitant to use what Americans call ""baking spices"" with meat but I&apos;m so glad I tried this (including the ginger).  The spices are perfectly blended and very subtle. I served it over egg noodles which works great with the gravy & meatballs. I would be very proud to serve this to dinner guests.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 lb ground beef & 1/2 lb ground pork instead of the 2/3 & 1/3 ratio in the recipe (just for practicality -- I will be making this again soon!)"
4,"Nice tender meatball. I had my grandmothers swedish meatball in mind when I tried this.....but this doesn&apos;t have enough seasoning for my taste. Otherwise, lovely and simple but I would zap up the nutmeg and allspice a tiny bit. My grandmother used to put a tiny bit of the allspice in the gravy too. I also served this with tiny yellow potatoes, lingonberries and carrots and brussel sprouts. Very nice combo. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe Nom Nom Nom :)"
4,"Hubs and I really enjoyed this tonight but I have to agree with the ""most  helpful"" reviewer - this was a tad too ""sour creamy,"" so if I had it to do over again, I, too, would like a meatier gravy and reduce the amount of sour cream.  Also, looking at the mix of ingredients it seemed to me that it would produce a really  ""wet"" mixture.  I decided to hold off adding the chicken broth and I&apos;m glad I did as the texture and consistency was just right without it.  Had I used it, I&apos;m afraid it might have been too loose, making it more difficult to form the meatballs.  I did add the optional ginger.  Glad I did that too.  I formed the mixture into approximately 1"" meatballs, and these required  only about 18 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees.   I used butter in place of the drippings for the roux.  The sour cream was different for me - I generally use heavy cream.  Wasn&apos;t sure I would like it as much, but not to worry, other than there being a little too much of it, we liked it nearly as well as we do when made with cream.  All and all, a good recipe - just needs some tweaking, I think, to perfect it to suit individual tastes and preferences."
4,"I only made the meatballs from this recipe, not the gravy.  I also used groung turkey rather than beef & pork.  That said, it&apos;s the spices that really make this recipe.  I was afraid the meatballs would taste ""odd"" using spices usully reserved for baked goods, but it&apos;s actually really good.  After baking the meatballs, I put them in a covered casserole with a can of cream of chicken & a can of cream of mushroom soup with some milk to make a gravy.  I baked them for about 40 minutes & then served over egg noodles.  Yum!"
5,"Yuuuummmm! This was so good - it vaguely reminds me of the Swedish meatballs my mother used to make whenever there was a party. I didn&apos;t have time for ""day-old"" bread so I lightly toasted two slices and crumbled those with the cream. Also I used a bit more meat (closer to 1 lb. of beef 1/2 lb. of pork) but otherwise everything else was the same. I recommend using all the spices incl. the brown sugar and ginger. They blend beautifully and the taste is subtle and delicious. Great recipe; thanks to NomNomNom for posting!"
2,"I followed recipe exactly like written... 
                                 I thought it was over the top sweet, almost like eating a cupcake. I think there were errors in cooking time, it took me well over 2 hours to make this and I am not an amatuer cook. I also think that if you try this recipe, do not add the sour cream to the simmered sauce unless you temper the sour cream or it can curdle. I&apos;m sorry but very disapointed in this recipe. I only gave it a two star beccause the meatball was tender and moist which is always nice. Just thought too much went into this"
5,"I liked the idea of such an easy dish, but I took the laziness a step further, when I make this (twice now and third time will be tonight), Just brown the meat and onion in a large pot, then drain and put it back in, add the rest of the ingredients and put a lid on it. 15 minutes later the cabbage is steamed, the rice is perfect and I just glop it in bowl with a dallop of sour cream. Must be the busy mom in me that gets so shortcutty! You can use chicken broth instead of beef."
4,"This was really tasty!  I read through a ton of reviews and two things stood out -- the dish needs more seasoning and it can become mushy when cooked 1-1/2 hrs.  Taking that into consideration, I socked the seasoning to the meat/onion while it was browning -- salt & pepper, a lot of garlic, oregano and basil and a heavy dose of both red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.  Also sprinkled some of all those things over the cabbage I&apos;d chopped (I estimate 10-12 cups, fairly large head).  To avoid ""mushy"" cabbage, I gave the rice a head start -- added the tomato sauce & half the broth to the browned meat/onion, then stirred in the rice, turned the burner off and let it hang out for about 10-15 mins.  I tossed it all together in a large bowl, poured into lasagna dish (way too much for 9x13) and baked covered for 50 mins.  Excellent!  Rice cooked perfectly and cabbage, while softened, still had a slight crunch.  Try this one, and don&apos;t be afraid to add a LOT of seasonings! :)"
5,"I would like to say that if someone didn&apos;t like this receipe, that they did something wrong or they just don&apos;t like cabbage.  I love this recipe! I found this recipe about a year ago and I have fixed it probaly 10 times since then.  I usually fix it when we have company (because it makes so much)and everyone asks for a copy of the recipe.  I usually add more tomato sauce than it calls for and I use one medium head of cabbage no matter what it weighs.  I add more salt than it calls for and I add plenty of black pepper.  It taste just like moms stuffed cabbage without all the work.  Mom even says so!"
5,"I thought this recipe was absolutely delicious. It was so tasty I had to have a second helping. Like some of the others, I also cut the recipe in half, using 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 an onion, 1/2 a large head of cabbage, 1 can of beef broth (14 oz), 2 cans (8 oz) of tomato sauce and 1 cup of rice. The only extra seasoning I added was salt. I turned up the temperature to 400 and found it was done in an hour. I will definitely be making this again!"
5,This is so GOOD & EASY !!!   I make it even simpler by putting it all in a crockpot...only use long cooking rice.
5,"This casserole was easy to make and delicious.  I did add a variety of spices, as suggested in earlier reviews, including Worstechsire sauce, a dash of hot sauce, garlic and nutmeg and a little vinegar to draw out the tomatoes. I used ground turkey to reduce the fat, and, possibly due to using drier meat, needed to add another cup and a half of tomato sauce.  I served it to company and they kept going back for &apos;just another bite&apos; well after we left the table and took a copy of the recipe home with them.  This recipe will make many appearances at my table."
5,"I made this last night.  I added some garlic powder and some pepper to the meat while it was cooking.  I also cooked the onions with the meat.  Stirred the rice into the pot with the meat and onions.  In a large, deep, foil roasting pan, I put a layer of cabbage and covered that with the meat/rice mixture.  I poured a cup of beef broth over the top and then added the spaghetti sauce on top of everything.  Covered with foil, and baked for 45 minutes.  After 45 min, I took it out of the oven, stirred it all together and then turned the oven down to 225 because I had to go out for an hour.  When we came back and had a taste test, it was PERFECT.  My BF loves my cooking, but he had 2 servings for his taste test, took some for his lunch today and wants me to make it again on the weekend!  I haven&apos;t seem him rave like this in a long time.  Thank you Nancy!!"
4,"Like a real cabbage roll, this recipe tastes better as leftovers, when the flavours have blended.  I modified the recipe quantities quite a bit so that I wouldn&apos;t end up with 2 9x13 pans of the stuff.  I guess I didn&apos;t cut back enough - I had a 6qt slow cooker full!  I added more rice and broth (1.5 c rice, 3 c broth), some diced tomatoes (14 oz), and a dash of chili powder, as well.  If you&apos;re going to slow-cooker this, you&apos;ll need about 6 hours on high, minimum, to cook the cabbage (I used 3 hours to start, and we crunched our way through supper the first nite!).  This is excellent served with sour cream and/or a nippy cheddar sprinkled on top. Yummy!"
5,"I took cyndib&apos;s advice and made the whole thing on the stovestop; worked like a charm!!!  After browning the beef in my large stock pot, I added the rest of the ingredients except the cabbage.  I brought it to a boil, reduced to a simmer, and put the cabbage on top of it all (didn&apos;t stir it).  Put the lid on and let everything simmer for 15 minutes; cabbage was nicely steamed and rice got cooked.  I halved the recipe since I only have a family of 3, and that was very easy to do.  Overall I really liked the flavor, though I did add plenty of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 1Tb of brown sugar (to cut the tomato acidity).  Nothing beats a homemade cabbage roll, but this was a good way to cheat :)"
1,"I decided to try this one again since I am usually very impressed with the recipes I try on this sight. I am an experienced cook and AGAIN tried this and folloed it and the cabbage was mushy and the flavors just weren&apos;t there. Needless to say, I will stick to REAL cabbage rolls since I have NEVER had a problem with them."
5,"This really is the best tasting hamburger ever!  All the people here complaining that it tastes too much like meatloaf can just go back to eating their boring old meat burgers with salt and pepper, because this recipe if for folks who desire some real flavor in the meat.  I made this recipe exactly as described, except I ommited the garlic clove, and used only a teaspoon of powdered garlic.  For the onion I used a red onion.  I mixed all of the other ingredients together before adding the meat, and I knew I was in for a treat when I saw how thick and rich all of the flavor ingredients were.  I used a george foreman grill, and was very happy with the final results.  My only mistake was my condiments.  There is no need to add a slice of onion on the burger, because it will be too overpowering.  Keep it down to a minimal with maybe just a slice of lettuce and a slice of tomatoe, and enjoy this hamburger for the flavor already in it.  Looking forward to leftovers tonight!"
2,Way toooooo SALTY!!! This recipe packs a lot of flavor but it&apos;s just NOT balanced.  Too much salt and I didn&apos;t even use salt.  Not one pinch!  Cut down on the onion soup mix...maybe this will help cut the salty flavor.
4,"I served this recipe a month ago, and it was very good. We&apos;re doing it again tonight. The only changes I made were to go light on the herbs & spices--about half the asked-for amounts. And no salt at all. The onion soup mix and soy sauce add all that&apos;s needed."
1,Made them for Mother&apos;s Day because my mom loves hamburgers and she took one bite and couldn&apos;t eat the rest.  Way too many ingredients and the rosemary was dreadful in a hamburger.
4,this was a really good recipe i left out the garlic powder and used real garlic it was alittle salty next time i will cut back onthe salty spices. we will always make this mix whenerver we grill burgers again
2,"This may be a good recipe if you want your burgers to taste like meatloaf.  -plus, that was without the onion soup mix. With the soup mix would be far too much seasoning.  Won&apos;t use this burger recipe again."
5,"these burgers kicked . the only thing i didnt add was the onion soup mix, i just didnt have it on hand, and they still kicked . very good, sastified both my male and female guest. i recommned the recipie to my older sister and she loved them as well."
5,This recipe was fabulous.  I grilled the burgers for a large group and everyone wanted to know what was in them.  They were a hit!
4,Good burger.
3,Just a simple request for when people make suggestions for substitutions--please include amounts! I made these burgers tonight and like one of the other reviewers I had no chipotle peppers but I did have the spice available. Unfortunately I had no idea how much to substitute for the chipotle pepper and ended up adding waaaaayyy too much spice to my burgers. They were blazing hot! I used 1 teaspoon of spice to 1 1/4 pound of ground sirloin (for four servings). So if anyone suggests a substitution please also suggest a quantity to use. I know I would really appreciate the help and maybe others would too. I enjoyed the burgers and I will give them another shot with either real chipotles or lower the amount of spice I use.
5,"We LOVE this recipe and have even used it with ground turkey.  I didn&apos;t follow the recipe exactly as I didn&apos;t have chipotle sauce or peppers.  And, after the first time, I also decreased the liquid smoke to 1 tsp because it seemed to be a little strong.  Amazing!"
5,Yummy! Very good grilled burger. I used garlic powder instead of the minced garlic and did half and half gound beef and ground turkey. I also used pepper jack cheese. I will use this recipe again.
5,"Tried these tonight- was going to make a meatloaf from the recipe as I didn&apos;t have any buns. The more I read the reviews I realized that these would be at their peak from grilling. So we had the burgers minus the buns and cheese. We got to taste the true flavor. Very very tasty. I might use a teeny bit less chipotles in adobo next time. My word on that ingredient is this-buy a small can put the remainder in an airtight container and keep it in the frig. I have been using the same container for about 6 months. Believe me it keeps its flavor and kick! And there&apos;s not really any great substitute when a recipe calls for it. One question for the others- what did they use as ""grill seasoning?"" I don&apos;t have any on hand as we do most of our own combinations to make rubs etc. I just used some paprika chili powder and smoked salt. We really loved these. This recipe elevates burgers to ""company"" status. Yum."
5,This was great. It was nice to have a very tasty burger for a change. My boyfriend raved about these to all his friends.
4,I used all the seasoning as noted except for the chilies as we are wimps in that department. I topped the burgers with Gouda cheese the last few minutes on the grill. I really liked the flavors of this burger and will make it again.
5,These are wonderful tasting burgers! This is the 3rd time that I&apos;ve used this recipe. The 2nd time I used ground turkey breast instead of beef. It was drier but still very good flavor. I&apos;ve also combined all of the ingredients (except the beef) in a bowl and made a paste like out of it and rubbed it on some fish that I was going to saute. It too was pretty darned good! The smokiness and heat of the chipotles combined with the liquid smoke is quite a tasty combo. I really like your recipe. Thanks! I would have never thought of this on my own!
4,We really enjoyed these burgers. I used onion powder since I don&apos;t care for onion and McCormick hamburger seasoning for the grill seasoning but it was too salty so next time I will make my own or use something else. I cut this in half for just the 3 of us. The canned chipotle peppers though barely had any adobo sauce so I scraped up what I could and used it. I used La Costena brand. I cooked this in a skillet/stovetop instead of grilling this time. Thanks Janine these were good and we will be having these again.
5,Incredible seasoning combination! I don&apos;t care for the heat of the chipotle peppers or adobo sauce so I subbed about a teaspoon of smoked paprika. I think I used a little less worcestershire sauce as well. These might be the best burgers I have made. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!
5,These turned out great! I served them with swiss cheese grilled onions and mushrooms on top. I also added 1 teaspoon of Aleppo Pepper & 1 teaspoon seasoning salt. To help the patties stay together I used 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1 egg.
5,Wow what a great recipe! I used our George Foreman grill for this and just cooked them for 6 minutes...no need to flip (I love that indoor grill!). I like the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand and DH loved the flavor. I saw on previous reviews some said that this reminded them of meatloaf??? Well to us it didn&apos;t. This burger had good flavor and I&apos;m glad we gave it a try! Thanks so much Jeff for posting...this will definately be a keeper in our house!
4,These were good but it reminded me of a meatball or meatloaf. I trated them like a normal burger cheese ketchup lettuce tomato and onion. I will try them again but I think I will either top them with mozzerella an roasted red peppers or tomato sauce and mozzerella.
5,"Flavors were outstanding! Maybe the people who thought otherwise used dried minced onions? I used a fresh onion and minced it up. I made just over 6lbs and ran out of Worcestershire so I used Dale&apos;s Seasoning to round out the amt I needed. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Also it is key to handle the meat as little as possible. After I mixed everything together (using wooden spoons kind of folding it in) I put into the fridge. I&apos;d made it the day prior to needing. The day of I took a 3/4 measuring cup and scooped out some of the meat. The measuring cup was just slightly overfilled. Then I gently pressed together into a ball. I placed the ball on a hot griddle (about 450) for 30 seconds. Flattened with spatula. Let it cook for 2 minutes. Flipped it and let it cook for 3 more minutes. It&apos;s the ""smash burger"" method I read about in my Food & Wine magazine. SO GOOD!!! The cooking method was great but the meat was just fantastic. I was afraid because I could smell the italian seasonings but when I was eating the burger patty (tried the night prior with just the meat & bread to really see if it was good) it just tasted like meaty goodness. Wouldn&apos;t change a thing. In fact I&apos;m totally gonna use this exact recipe & altered cooking method to make hamburger steaks. Make a nice onion mushroom brown gravy to go over these bad boys? Oh yeah good eating. I could not be happier with this simple yet flavorful beef patty. THANK YOU!"
5,These burgers were delicious!!! I used garlic powder (California blend)instead of fresh. I look forward to making these again and again!! They didn&apos;t taste like meatloaf to me like some of the reviews have mentioned! My whole family loved these thanks for a great recipe!
5,These burgers are delicious! They do NOT taste anything like meatloaf. I was a little leary of the italian seasoning but it was perfect. Didn&apos;t change a thing. Great on toasted rolls!
5,"These were great. Moist and didn&apos;t fall apart! I did omit the extra salt for dietary reasons as W. sauce has so much, but otherwise followed as written. Everyone loved them! I believe mixing everything then refridgerating helps the flavor so much. Thanks for a keeper!"
4,We used ground round for these. As I always say you need a little fat in a burger to make it juicy. Added a bit of tabasco sauce. Really good stuff and we thank you Jeff!
5,Great burger recipe.  I let my hamburger meat marinate for a day and got rave reviews.
3,We thought the Italian seasoning was overpowering.  It was all we could taste and my husband was burping it up for hours.  Next time we will leave it out so we can taste the yummy onion and garlic!
5,"Hi all... I submitted this recipe - just to clarify, I use two packages of the King Hawaiian Sweet dinner rolls (in the orange bag, remove the cardboard tray it comes in).  You can just slice the tops off all at once and spread the beef mixture on the ""bottoms"".  Make sure to spray the foil with Pam so they don&apos;t stick.  I also don&apos;t put them on a cookie sheet, just wrap the whole thing in foil and pop in the oven, this prevents the bottoms from burning against the hot cookie sheet and keeps the buns soft.  Make sure to drain the grease and let the beef mixture cool a bit before adding mayo and cheese so it doesn&apos;t separate and get too oily.  These are always the hit of the party!  Tastes just like White Castles!"
5,"Great advice to just cook these wrapped in foil and of course drain the beef and cool before adding the cheese and mayo and using 1/2 to 3/4 of the onion mix ! The only addition I made to the recipe that continues to result in men and women asking for my recipe is: I add a special butter sauce to the top, borrowed from another great recipe.  Here it is:  2 tbsp minced onion flakes, 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tbsp Dijon or Spicey Mustard (not the regular yellow), 1/2 cup melted butter.  You melt these together and brush ontop of the buns just before you put in the oven to bake.  The men who have eaten this, always ask for the recipe!"
5,"I have made these twice and I did not cook the meat before adding to the buns.  I just mixed everything together, put the mixture on the buns and baked for 30 min.  They turned out fantastic!!!"
5,"I made this recipe today for 47 kids ranging in age from 6-17. The kids LOVED it!  I tripled the recipe, although I cooked it as written for each batch.  I thought the meat mixture would be more consistant doing it that way...and it would take the guess work out of how much meat goes on a package of rolls...I rated it 4 stars because of changes I made.  I usually ALWAYS make the recipe exactly as stated the first time around, but couldn&apos;t on this one.  The recipe doesn&apos;t call for draining the ground beef after it is cooked, which I felt needed to be done.  I think it would be too greasy otherwise.  I followed the recipe other than draining the grease and adding a pickle to the burger before I baked it.  I also followed the review from the Dena who posted the recipe, i.e. not using a baking pan and waiting for the meat to cool before adding the mayo/cheese also, I used Hawaiian King rolls as suggested.  Thank you SO much for a fabulous recipe!  I will definitely make it again and again!"
4,"I tried this recipe with two packages of onion soup mix as suggested by DenaInChicago. Both my husband and I thought it was way too salty. I could only eat one because of how salty it was. I liked the extra onion flavor, but not the extra salt. I&apos;m going to try it again with only 1 package of soup mix and some diced onions for the extra onion flavor. I think I&apos;ll make this a regular for us, just never again with 2 packages of soup mix."
5,"We loved these!  So, so tasty and very easy.  Used the King&apos;s Hawaiian rolls from the deli section of the grocery.  We served these at a party.  Since I wanted as little prep as possible the day of the party, I browned the beef w/ soup mix the day before and put in a tupperware.  The next day, I threw the meat mix in the microwave for a couple of minutes while I got the cheese and mayo (among other party fixings) ready to go.  Mixed everything up, put it on the rolls and popped in the oven.  My husband raved--said it was way better than Krystal burgers!  I&apos;d definitely make these again, especially for a football party or the like."
5,"So yummy! I added some finely chopped onion while cooking the meat, used 93/7 ground turkey, and topped the burgers with sliced dill pickles before baking. Other than that, I followed the recipe. These are so close to White Castle burgers and even better, you can make tweaks to make them healthier, like using wheat buns. If you&apos;re worried about how much onion soup mix you&apos;re using, just add less at first and more to taste after the meat has cooked. Adding a little water can help the meat soak it up. I will definitely be making these again."
4,These were delicious! The kids said I should make them all the time! DH said they taste like White Castles!.. I chopped up a small onion real fine and simmered it into my meat skipped the soup mix. Only 4 stars because with all the mayo and cheese they were quite rich and I could only eat two; next time I may cut it back to half the cheese and mayo!.. I actually used one package of rolls(12) with half the filling for dinner and still had the other package of rolls and half the filling for the next day.
5,"Love it! An easy and unique way to prepare sliders. I used 1 pound of beef to make 12 burgers instead of 24, and added a chopped onion to the skillet when cooking the meat. Also added the pickle to the burgers prior to baking. Came out great and I&apos;ll definitely be making these again and trying some different mixes."
1,These did not work for my family at all. Scaled it down to make 12 called for 1/2 cup mayo put less the 1/4 cup and the mayo was all I could taste - not good. Bummer was hoping this could be come a new add in to the rotation since it is easy to prepare. Oh well sometimes you win sometimes you lose...
5,One of the easiest & most delicious burger recipes I&apos;ve had in a long time. I also recommend adding Worcestershire sauce as well.
5,Delicious!  I added some worcestershire sauce and some bread crumbs and these burgers came out perfectly.  Will definitely fix again.
5,"After years of making dry hamburgers, my husband gently suggested looking for a recipe :) ...now I know what I&apos;ve been doing wrong all this time..thank you!"
5,"Delicious! Hubby raved about this burger. I followed the recipe as directed, but did take reviewers&apos; recommendations and added a TBS of Worcestershire sauce. I used two cloves of fresh garlic and I think that made all the difference. I agree that the egg may not be necessary, and will try it w/o next time....and there will be a next time!"
3,Pretty good. I left out the egg just like my hamburgers like good ole burgers; I added some liquid smoke to give it a smoked flavor.
5,These hamburgers are great!! I was searching for a good burger recipe because my kids will eat fast food burgers but not ones I&apos;d cook at home! (very frustrating!) They both will eat these burgers the only thing I do differently is garlic powder instead of minced.
5,"I thought these were great! I used 2 lbs. of meat, 3TBS. of good quality steak sauce, 1 teas. of crushed garlic, 2 TBS. of Worstchesire, S&P, and 2 eggs. Mixed well with hands. Grilled on the grill and served on toasted rolls with lettuce, tomato,red onion, mayonaise and crumbled blue cheese. Terrific!"
4,Yum! I left out the egg & added 1 tsp worch sauce. instead of the garlic I used 1/4 tsp garlic salt. Hubby loved them!
5,Excellent burger! 5 Stars!
5,Okay my husband just adout died over these hamburgers. I used Portabello mushrooms bacon and monterey jack cheese for the filling. Per another viewer make small hamburgers and press the filling into the hamburger and place another patty on top and seal. In the meat mixture I used 1/3C. bread crumbs 1 egg (egg beaters) 1 tsp. worchestshire sauce 1 1/2 tsp. montreal steak seasoning.
4,A great new twist for a burger! For those of you having trouble with the potatoes simply buy a bag of shredded hash browns - very quick & simple!
5,These burgers are a great alternative to the same old same old burgers I always have. I bought a bag of pre-shredded hash brown potatos and fried them up before stuffing the burgers so I wouldn&apos;t have to worry about the potato cooking all the way through it also added that yummy fried potato flavor! I&apos;ve made these with lots of different variations for fillings but my favorite is potato cheddar and crumbled bacon. My boyfriend&apos;s favorite is the original potato/mushroom/swiss. Any fillings work well for this burger so get creative! I gave my sister this recipe and she makes hers with cream cheese avacado and sundried tomatoes yum!
5,So good I couldn&apos;t believe it I wish I&apos;d found this recipe a long time ago. I grilled the burgers on the stove and bought pre-shredded potatoes and cooked them first. I also made really thin hamburger patties then put the filling on top of them then placed another thin patty on top of that and sealed it up-way easier than making pockets. I&apos;m sure you could stuff these with just about anything but try the original first it&apos;s awesome.
5,Very good. Instead of making a pocket I halved each burger pressed the filling (mushrooms cheese) on one of the halves and then placed the other half on top. Anyway these are a family favorite. Thanks for sharing.
3,These were tasty but I felt the meat mixture was too sticky. I added 1 egg and 1/2 cp. breadcrumbs so the patties would be easier to form.
5,These were amazing! The first time we had them my husband was craving the leftovers all the next day! We&apos;ve now made them twice the first time with ground beef and the onion soup (we also used the frozen hashbrowns instead of potatoes) and it was a bit to oniony for me (plus I really don&apos;t like beef) but we had them again this week with ground pork and I seasoned the meat with some dried onion garlic and pepper and I liked it SO much more! SO YUMMY!! I can&apos;t wait to make them for a BBQ party!
5,These burgers are HUGE and very yummy. I used the shredded hashbrown poataoes as suggested and they worked great. I also used cheddar instead of swiss cheese. We&apos;ll make these again for sure.
5,My husband said that this was the best hamburger he had ever had.
5,"I was somewhat hesitant to try this recipe after seeing that it had only 3.5 stars (I know, 3.5 - I don&apos;t like wasting food). However, I tried it, as I wanted a plain burger that I could top with ketchup, mustard, onions, and pickles - in other words traditional toppings. I&apos;m not one for fish burgers or anything gourmand-like like that. 
                                
                                To the user that said that this burger was tasteless, I would say that the burger would be tasteless by itself and with no condiments. However, I added a slice of cheese (let it melt a bit under the burger patty), pickles, ketchup, mustard, a couple slices of onions, and wow. It was great. Let me just say that I won&apos;t be going to Burger King for a while. This burger tasted great - it tasted so juicy and meaty! I had one for lunch and one for dinner. Deelish."
5,"This is exactly as stated ""a perfect basic burger"".  It&apos;s simple and if you look at the ingredients the flavor will come from the beef you use, so use a good grade of beef.  It also holds the burger together well on the grill.  It&apos;s almost like what McDonald&apos;s uses. This is the perfect base to add some really great condiments.  I used cheese, pickles, finely chopped onion, lettuce, tomato and ""Best Burger Sauce"" from this site. I normally don&apos;t do that with other burger recipes from this site because they stand on their own due to the amount of seasonings, spices and other additions.  Those call for just lettuce, tomato and bun.  You don&apos;t want to ruin the flavor with a bunch of condiments. If you&apos;re looking for a lot of spice this isn&apos;t for you.  If you want to experiment with some different toppings or condiments this is the burger to try it on!"
5,"This is a BASIC recipe, very few ingredients so what would you expect? A lot of the taste will come from the ground beef you are using, low grade ground beef will yield a pretty much bland tasting burger.  You should always use a good ground beef for plain hamburgers, use good, you get good.  Simple.  These are great tasting."
3,"This is just that the perfect basic burger, nothing fancy and really a rather plain taste.  However, if you are planning on dressing it up with toppings it is the way to go as your hamburger patty will not compete with the toppings."
5,Simple traditional and good for the masses because it&apos;s versatile. I served them at a casual cook-out of family and friends. If you are looking for a non-traditional gourmet burger then this recipe is not for you. I made as directed. Those guests that wanted cheese added cheese those that wanted onion added onion etc. Just like it reads this was the perfect basic burger.
4,It was the description that made me want to make these! Since the weather was so nice - I decided to barbecue. A simple recipe but I added some fresh spinach leaves and cheese which dressed it up.
1,Tasteless. Just add your favorite seasonings to the meat and a little liquid smoke for the perfect burger.
5,Delicious all the others who say bland tasteless they are wrong this burger is wonderful especially if you add cheese.I LOVE THIS BURGER
5,Easy quick and tastes great!
5,"Minnesota&apos;s contribution to the culinary world!  Don&apos;t forget to let this gem sit for a few minutes before taking your first bite, or you will have molten lava dribbling down your chin."
4,"The recipe is very good as it is, but fantastic if you double the wochestershire sauce and I like to use 2 tsp of montreal steak seasoning in place of the garlic salt and pepper.
                                Two very important things - it is absolutely critical that you leave enough room on the edges to get a good seal.  If the cheese runs out, not near as good.  And by the way, if the cheese does start to run out, its done!  Get it off the grill or pan before you lose your cheese!  I tried to make this a little healthier with 94% lean burger....not near as good as when I made the exact same recipe with 80% lean.  You need the fat and grease for a great burger.
                                BTW - I saw 1 review that gave 1 star because the cheese leaked out (user error) and 1 gave a low rating because the recipe has a lot of fat.  REALLY?  Rate on the quality of the recipe, not on your ability to cook or you opinion of what is healthy or not."
5,Just about the best burger ever.  Saw the recipe on a food showdown recently.  Introduced it to my husband today for lunch and he was impressed.  Fresh ground beef is a must.  We like 2 pieces of cheese per burger.  A little messier but oooh sooo worth it.  Keep the napkins handy.
3,I have made these before. They are good with Blue Cheese. Try making with your favorite cheese and you will like it.
5,"Needed a new burger idea so I turned to ""the buzz"" for a fast recommendation and this was the only one that was suggested- ( NOT a recipe that would have caught my eye). I followed the recipe as directed except with lean beef because that&apos;s what I had on hand. I was a bit concerned about all of the ""ooze"" warnings so I smashed the patties out on waxed paper between two salad plates so the thickness would be as uniform as possible and turned the edges like a pie crust to seal. Surprisingly none of the cheese blew out it almost ""absorbed"" into the burger. Served it on toasted Portuguese rolls with leaf lettuce tomato and red onion. I had some ""In-a-Pinch Ketchup"" in the fridge (recipe I found on AR) and the flavors complimented perfectly. These burgers are sooo ""slap your mama"" good (no offense ""Cooking Mama""!) and we just can&apos;t wait to try them on the grill!....Thanks for sharing this one."
5,If it is anything like Matt&apos;s Famous Juicy Lucy - they will be fabulous!  The recipe sounds just like it.
5,I liked the idea of putting the cheese inside the burgers; makes them neater! Instead of the garlic salt and black pepper I used Montreal Steak Seasoning. We both liked these and would make them again but next time I want to try them with pepper jack.
3,"Somehow my initial review was deleted. I basically said what another person said i.e. ""heart attack on a bun "" although I wouldn&apos;t make quite so drastic an evaluation. However due to its high calorie and high fat content this is the sort of thing that should be eaten sparingly. I used very very lean ground beef and low fat cheese which helped to mitigate some of the unhealthier attributes of this burger. Having eaten one just a few days ago I won&apos;t have another for probably six months. Just too much fat!"
4,Great way to do burgers. I do similiar with Meat Loaf; half ground beef mixture (I also add a little squirt of Mustard and BBQ Sauce) on bottom of loaf pan then lots of layers of Cheese then top off with rest of beef. Pinch layers together to seal Cheese in.
5,I&apos;ve been making this recipe for years and it&apos;s always been a hit. The only changes that I made was to omit the salt and sometimes use thyme and/or steak spice. I also add 1 egg so that the patties stay glued together while on the grill.  Thanks for sharing.
4,Great hamburger! I love grilling with beer. I used about 1 & 1/4 lbs. of ground beef and about 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion along with the garlic. I kept the other measurements the same (1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire & 1/4 c. beer). There&apos;s never a shortage of beer in this house so we used Michelob Ultra. I think any type of full bodied beer will work fine in this recipe. Instead of a tsp. of salt and 1/4 tsp. of pepper I used 1 & 1/4 tsp. of McCormick&apos;s Montreal Steak Seasoning. After mixing the ground beef we let it set for a half hour in the fridge before making the patties to let the flavors come together. These burgers came out very moist and juicy -perfect on a toasted sesame seed roll with melted cheese lettuce and tomato.
4,I will definitely try this recipe again. The burgers were quite tasty. However the burgers tended to break apart. Next time I will try with a little less beer.
4,I think it was too much beer the burger was too tender. I made this three ways I took the 1/4 of beer and put it in a pot and cooked it down to 1 Oz. this still gave the full flavor of the beer but still made the beef patty tender. I also used 1 oz of dark German beer and a good Belgium beer. The left over beer I drank I hate waste.
5,"Yum! These burgers were super. I used 93/7 ground turkey instead of beef, the meat mixture did seem very thin and I was worried that these wouldn&apos;t hold together well on the grill so I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. Topped with extra sharp white cheddar and served on a hawaiian roll. Thanks for the recipe, we will be making these often!"
5,Pretty darn good little burgers! My only change was to use steak seasoning in place of the salt & pepper. I did these indoors on the grill pan. Looking forward to trying these on the outdoor grill this Summer. Thanks for sharing!
5,These were really tasty. I overcooked a bit but they still came out savory. I added a few dashes of cayenne and paprika. Everyone loved them.
4,Pretty good although the consistency when shaping the patties was really soft even after adding an egg. They were hard to flip but the end result was yummy!
5,These burgers were fantastic! I added an egg and used burger seasoning instead of salt and pepper everyone loved them so much they were still talking about them the next day! Thanks for a great recipe!
1,Waste of time. Drink the beer. The burgers don&apos;t need it.
5,Absolutely fantastic! Did once without cilantro (at the request of my mother) and then again later when she wasn&apos;t visiting. Personally I think the cilantro really adds some zip to the whole thing - don&apos;t leave it out if you have the choice! Still even without the cilantro this is a GREAT recipe. Lots of zing and heat. Edit: If you&apos;re having trouble forming a patty with this recipe - An easy trick is to use two forks so that you don&apos;t over-handle the meat. Overlap pieces together start small and work your way up keeping the patty even throughout. Don&apos;t smash anything down! You might want to add a cup of oatmeal or breadcrumbs if you&apos;re really having a hard time of it.
2,NO WAY would I pay 20 for this burger. I spent enough for the ingredients as is. Sorry.
5,I made these last night and just had the last one for lunch..very good!! I&apos;ll be making these again and again;0) I didn&apos;t have cilantro but can&apos;t wait to make these with cilantro.
5,We have made this burger several times already... it is so delicious! It&apos;s also a fun one to experiment with adding new and unique ingredients. A word of caution if you experiment though.... my husband and I did find is that if you add too many &apos;wet&apos; ingredients the burgers won&apos;t stick together and become difficult to grill. Perhaps the addition of breadcrumbs or instant rice might combat this. Otherwise this burger gets our stamp of approval! It is PACKED with flavor!
5,These burgers were absolutely delicious so flavorful. Served them at a BBQ and everyone ate them up. Loved the horseradish mayo a real bonus.
4,Good taste but it was pretty hard to get them to stick together. If you squeeze the patties out inside paper towels before putting them on the grill that helps.
5,Everyone in my family LOVED this burger!
5,I made these for a house full of teenagers and I got great reviews. They said they were the best homemade hamburgers they ever had.
5,Loved this burger!I never leave comments for recipes but this was so good I just had to!I used sour cream instead of yogurt and I can defintly see why some people used breadcrumbs to help hold it together.I didn&apos;t but I dont see how they could do anything but help I used a george foreman grill so no flipping was needed so that probably helped keep it together.So yummy defintly a must try!
4,"These ""burgers"" are not your traditional burger by any means, so the ketchup mustard route is not your best choice. Being Italian by spice addition, I chose to serve the burgers with an aioli and fresh mozzarella slices on a a rosemary/red onion foccacia instead of a hamburger bun. Keep it Italian and you can&apos;t go wrong with this delicious twist to the all-American burger."
4,"Very good recipe. My kids (12 & 17) enjoyed it a LOT. Was fun trying to get them to pic the ""different"" spice!! KINA!! I was taught how to make a burger patty long ago. Make into a ball...then between your palms flatten the burger to where you want it....thick or thin. As you flatten it...keep turning the burger and gently squeeze the sides together to get ALL the air pockets out....dont make TOO thin or it will be tough. Its not like making meatloaf....you need to handle the burger more to get all the air out...wont have any cracking and wont have that ""ball"" problem!!! Good luck...."
5,Probably the best burgers I have ever made! Very hearty! I wouldn&apos;t recommend this recipe for picky eaters - if you&apos;re used to bland this may overwhelm you... but if you&apos;re used to a little Garlic and like Basil you simply MUST try these. DELICIOUS.
4,We enjoyed these Chris. For a pound of ground beef I found 1 Tbsp. olive oil and 1 tsp. salt to be adequate for our taste. A bit of worcestershire might have been a nice addition. Thanks for the post.
5,These hamburgers were so good! I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I added a dash of cayenne pepper also. Other than that no changes.
5,These burgers are like ones you get at a nice restaurant. The taste is amazing. I could definitely eat this burger without any condiments or bread or anything!
3,I didn&apos;t care for these too much. They were salty and the basil was too strong for out tastes. Both my husband and I loaded them with other things to cover the taste.
5,GREAT BURGER... I added a little more garlic with some onion and a little less salt. Be careful with the oil I cut back on that a little too! It kept making the grill flare up. Otherwise THE GUYS LOVED THEM!
5,I made this last night for company and everybody raved about it! A very flavorful yummy burger. We will never make our old plain burgers again after trying this one.
5,"Other than setting the ADT smoke alarm off as I was grilling these in a cast iron grill pan these hamburgers made for a delicious and delightful dinner! (At least the grill marks looked really cool...) Hubs was less than enthusiastic about these when he learned there were sun-dried tomatoes in them. I on the other hand was excited to try this interesting and mouth-watering combination of ingredients. After setting off the alarm then hurrying to take a picture of them before they got cold I had all but lost interest in them and just wanted to get supper over with. We sat down to eat and our first response was of raised eyebrows and a ""Wow these are really good!"" Hubs ended up not finishing the soup we had with these just so that he could have a second burger and I was glad I only made three so I couldn&apos;t have a second one myself. What a delicious unique kind of unusual hard to describe but wonderful flavor these had! And don&apos;t think for a minute that these are little mini-meatloaves what with the breadcrumbs and egg - there isn&apos;t enough of either to make that error. While these just as easily could be served on regular hamburger rolls or ciabatta bread there was something special about the toasted and buttered English muffins. A little tomato and lettuce was all that was needed to complete this wonderful burger. Really pleased with your recipe Chester! As hubs put it this took the simple burger to the next level!"
5,"Excellent burger! I love sun-dried tomatoes and the addition of these inside the burger meat was fabulous! I used Italian-style bread crumbs and choppd the green bell pepper very fine (using about half the amount) as I didn&apos;t want to have any unwanted ""crunch"" in my burger. The addition of the Tabasco gave it a really nice kick! I got four nice sized patties out this and chose to grill these as burgers fried in a pan tend to be ""greasy"" and don&apos;t have the same flavor that comes from being cooked on a grill - personal preference I suppose. I was lucky enough to find the ""sandwich-sized"" English muffins at my grocery store and toasted them which was a nice change from regular hamburger rolls - maybe it was due to those famous ""nooks and crannies"". These were excellent topped with Cheddar cheese lettuce and tomato - YUM!"
5,This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I made the recipe as directed the only thing I added was a little bit of liquid smoke and grilled them. The flavor was amazing:) I also bought some buns from the deli instead of english muffins.
5,These burgers were GREAT! Used pretzel rolls instead of english muffins topped w/blue cheese bacon and spinach. This is probably our favorite burger. Thanks for the recipe.
5,"Wonderful! Reminiscent of my ""meatloaf burgers"" but the addition of the sun dried tomatoes and dash of Tabasco takes it over the top! Thanks Chester!"
5,Absolutely delicious. I made bigger burgers out of these and I loved the English muffins! Thanks Chester!
5,We loved these. I grated the garlic as its easier to me than chopping/mincing. Everything else I followed just as written. I had never worked with sun-dried toms so that was new but found I enjoyed them. Excellent mu husband wants them again soon! Thank you.
5,Absolutely yummy! I was looking for a recipe to use up some sun dried tomatoes and I&apos;m glad I gave these a chance! I will probably use this recipe as my go-to hamburger recipe from now on. I shaped them into 6 patties rather than 8 and cooked in a skillet as directed but from now on we will use the grill because I hate dealing with all the grease. We served them on regular sesame seed hamburger buns with lettuce pickle mayo and mustard. Can&apos;t imagine how they would be on toasted English muffins.... I&apos;m sure it&apos;s good but we&apos;ll stick with traditional hamburger buns. Thanks for the great recipe!
5,We ve made these twice now and really enjoyed them. They are not your typical burger but yummy just the same. Both times we ve used these to make what we call a burger salad. I followed the recipe for the burgers but then I marinated them in a little sun-dried tomato vinaigrette before grilling. We serve them on mixed greens with green onions and diced tomatoes all drizzled with a little more vinaigrette. Saves the calories and carbs you d get eating it on the English muffin or a bun! We love this!
5,"I&apos;m in the process of making these burgers now and just wanted to get something cleared up. Most everyone knows that the juiciest burgers come from ground beef that has a higher fat content. If you use lean beef, you&apos;re gonna get ""meatloaf"". 80% lean and 20% fat content is pretty much the standard. What percentage of fat do you use in your recipe? thanks, (they smell really good). I&apos;m grilling them on a Foreman grill which are known for draining off the fat (and the moisture)from most meats.I&apos;m waiting...waiting...
                                I&apos;m amazed,I watched the juices flowing out of the burgers and into the tray and thought ""here we go again...hot and  dry ground beef on a bun. For not the first time in my life, I was wrong.
                                A very pleasant juicy burger. I wonder which ingredient or combination thereof keeps the juices in? A definite keeper, thank you."
1,"These burgers are meatballs or meatloaf in burger shape and grilled. If a tasty, juicy burger is what you&apos;re looking for, try this:  Add 1 tbs of Olive Oil to one pound of ground beef (I use chuck). Then add 1 tbs Worcestershire, 1 tsp each of garlic & onion powder, salt & pepper to taste. Mix well. Add or subtract any spices you like, but make sure you use 1 tbs each of Olive Oil & Worcestershire per pound of ground beef and you will have the tastiest, juiciest burgers you&apos;ve ever had!"
5,"Excellent!!  So good!  I prepared them the same way I make my meatballs....soak the bread in the milk until it is soggy (about 5 min) add add to ground beef, and use only the YOLK of the egg (the whites only add water-- the yolk has the protein to help &apos;glue&apos; it all together).  Wonderful...thanks for sharing!"
4,"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who don&apos;t like bread crumbs in their burgers, I find that the store bought bread crumbs change the taste and texture of the burgers and not for the better.  To get around this problem I use 1 to 1 1/2 slice of bread for every pound of meat and drizzle the bread with just enough milk to get it moist, I think its about 2 tbsp of milk.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same and the burgers turned out really moist and had good flavor.  Thanks for the recipe."
5,"I&apos;ve been making burgers like this for years, minus the cayenne.  Sometimes I add a 1/4 cup of minced onion to the mix.  I&apos;ve even found that I can mix these up, shape into patties, and freeze them raw just like this, on a cookie sheet.  When they&apos;re frozen solid, I toss &apos;em in a ziplog bag and keep them in the freezer for up to six months.  When I want a burger on a rainy day, a wintry day, or just one at a time, I mist a frying pan with cooking spray and cook about 7 minutes per side.  They come out just as good as when they&apos;re freshly made!"
5,The best burgers I ever had.  I use regular milk.  My friends came over to eat and they just loved them.  Will be making over and over. Thank you Jane.
5,"I made these yesterday for a barbeque that we had, every single guest told me how great the hamburgers were. I used 3 lbs of ground beef and adjusted the recipe accordingly also had to use seasoned bread crumbs because thats what I had on hand. Definely a keeper! Thanks :)"
5,This recipe was quite good and juicy. I tried this for the first time on my in-laws and they loved the burgers. I used garlic powder instead of minced gloves and sauted onions for some extra flavor and the taste was wonderful. Definitely a keeper.
5,This recipe came out GREAT! I actually cooked them on my George Forman Grill because it&apos;s still too cold to cook outside. The only thing is that they came out kind of smaller than I expected so maybe I&apos;ll add more ground beef next time. It was a hit in my house! Thanks!
4,"I cut this down to four servings for the Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers, which is also from this site. I cut back the salt to just a pinch as we&apos;re trying to cut back quite a bit on excess salt. Great hamburger seasoning. Wait, TURKEY burger seasoning. I&apos;ll use this often. (Oh! I also used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend instead of plain brown sugar.) EDITED: I use this now as my basic go-to grill seasoning. Works great for us."
5,I mixed 2 t. of the seasoning into 1 lb. of hamburger before making into patties.  When cooking I sprinkled each patty with the seasoning. I plan on using on other meats too.
5,"This is great for grilled hamburgers!  I usually just use a bit of Montreal Steak seasoning, but I was looking for something different and this was perfect.  I cut the recipe in half for just over a lb. of hamburger. I cut back a little on the paprika, but other than that followed it exactly. The burgers had a very nice flavor. This is a definite keeper and I&apos;ll be making some up and keeping it in a little jar to have on hand for grilling over the summer months. For a different twist, try using smoked paprika vs regular..."
5,"Wow!  I think this was the best hamburger I&apos;ve ever had!  I know lots of things come into play when making a good hamburger.  I used Costco&apos;s organic ground beef (85/15) and added 2 teaspoons of seasoning per pound (, as other reviewers recommended.  I&apos;m not sure why Stacey did not include information in the orginial recipe, considering this is a critical piece of information.  ""Season to taste"" is hardly an option!  Anyway, I used a hamburger patty press to create 6 oz. patties.  We grilled these on a propane grill.  We would normally use a charcoal grill but since we were cooking for a large crowd, it wasn&apos;t an option.  Everyone snached these up fast.  Even the kids!  Thanks Stacey!"
5,"I make this up in bulk (64 servings!)and keep in an airtight jar.  It&apos;s great for most dishes that call for ground beef or ground turkey.  I&apos;ve used it as a starter mix for chili, meat loaf, and meat+ casseroles. About 2 tsps per lb of ground meat is usually about right for me."
5,"WOW! This was soooo yummy! I never knew a few spices could change a hamburger so much! I have never been very good at hamburgers, but I am NOW! If you are worried about the cayenne pepper and black pepper making it spicy, don&apos;t worry, it&apos;s not. SO tasty!!!!!!!"
5,I have been eating hamburgers for over 40 years so that right there makes me an expert right? Seriously this seasoning recipe is the bomb! I have never used anything before except maybe garlic powder and salt and that just made it taste like garlic podwer and salt. This is the perfect mix for some reason. Every bite was incredible. I made the recipe here without any changes. I made the burgers three times using this mix. The first time they were good but the next time I used more on each burger and they were really good. Tonight I put a lot more on the burgers and wiped it all over with my fingers so every part was covered. They were finally great! Now I know I need to be liberal with how much to put on and the burgers will blow you away. I liken the taste to Longhorn&apos;s bacon cheddar burgers. They use something called Prairie Dust on their burgers and some of their steaks. Thank you for this recipe.
2,I was looking for a change to my hamburger recipe. I only made 4 patties out of the mixture in case we didn&apos;t like them. Needless to say my husband and I didn&apos;t care for this recipe -- and my husband eats beef cooked in any way shape or form! I ended up mixing the rest of the mixture with more hamburgar and ingredients from my own recipe -- they were so much tastier. Based on the reviews I really wanted to like these. Sorry Stacey:-(
5,Wow seasoning was amazing. I did add extra garlic and onion powder and it was superb. I broiled these and added swiss cheese during the last 5 minutes. A keeper for sure thanks so much.
3,"I usually LOVE your recipes/videos. Sadly, I was disappointed with your rendition of Loco Moco. This Hawaii girl has NEVER had Loco Moco without lots of carmelized onions layered over the ground beef/fish/spam. The gravy was too salty without the addition of sweet carmelized onions to offset the saltiness.  I  think you took a simple dish and made it way mo complex than it has to be.  Come on over and I will make you real Loco Moco ;)"
4,I made this and it turned out pretty well.  The only change was to use a brown rice/wild rice blend since we can&apos;t eat white rice any more.  My burgers were 4-5 ounces so I put two on the plate topped with the egg. I let my gravy get fairly thick and I only used 1 tsp of sugar. This is a good and filling meal.
5,Easy to follow directions. So delicious!!
5,"I have made this twice now, and it turned out amazing both times. The gravy has a great depth of flavor. I&apos;ve just used minute rice each time, but I have tried to elevate it a little with seasoning. The most recent time I made it, I added garlic/onion powder, turmeric, sage, thyme, and a little chili oil. It was beautifully aromatic, and complemented the patty and gravy well!"
5,"A family favorite, so tasty!"
4,Mushroom gravy...yum
3,Let me start off by saying this is the first time I have ever had Loco Moco so I don&apos;t have anything to compare it to but this recipe was just ok.  It didn&apos;t have much flavor.  My husband and I like food with lots of flavor so we didn&apos;t care for this but our daughter did like it.
5,I used liquid amino instead of soy sauce.
5,As we sat down to eat I realized I forgot the ketchup. My hubby loved it anyway. He said it was a definite keeper. We love dishes with fried eggs. The eggs brought this dish up from a 3-4 star to a 5 star dish.
4,"Great recipe - fantastic touch with the soy in the mushrooms.  Some slight variations for my health conscious family:  Burgers: - Seasoned with 1 egg, 2 tbsp of water, 1/4 dry multigrain breadcrumbs (can use regular), 1 small onion finely chopped, 2 tsp of dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 worcestershire sauce for every 1 lb of lean ground beef. (Didn&apos;t use the meat tenderizer since the water kept it moist) - Added swiss cheese to each burger when cooked and on the grill. (Can be done in a pan as well - make sure to drain the fat)  Mushrooms: - A little extra virgin olive oil instead of butter - Added 1/4 tsp minced garlic to warm olive oil - Brought the temperature down to medium and lay fresh sliced mushrooms flat on a skillet and let it stew in its own juices rather than stirring.  This brings out the full flavour of the mushrooms. - Added the soy at when the mushrooms were near cooked (last minute or two)  Additions: - Using the same olive oil in the mushroom skillet, added 1 medium red onion cut into thin rounds and sautéed. Okay to stir. - Used multigrain thin bread bun thins (Earthgrains 100% Multigrain Thin Buns are really good - can be found in any grocery store, Nature&apos;s own multigrain sandwich rounds are great too, Dempster&apos;s Thinfuls are available in Canada, but not as healthy at the others) - Used baby spinach leaves instead of lettuce on the buns - Added a few hot peppers to top off the burger for a little kick  Amazing - will be making more often"
3,This was just okay I made some modifications and hoped it would be more like a restaurant mushroom-swiss burger. In addition to the seasoning salt I also added freshly ground black pepper and minced garlic to the ground beef. I sautéd fresh baby portobello mushrooms instead of canned and also added grilled onions. Still it was good but not great. A nice base recipe I&apos;ll keep experimenting with.
5,Delicious! Super fast to prepare too. We didn&apos;t need any other stuff on our burgers. I used less soy sauce because I didn&apos;t want the mushrooms to get too salty.
4,If you want to kick this up a notch and make it taste like restaurant mushroom burger sauce stir a little dollop of sour cream into your mushroom mixture after you&apos;ve taken it off the heat. Perfection!
4,As written I would give 3.5 stars. I made this a couple times trying to improve upon it to fit our tastes and I found adding a can of Golden Mushroom condensed soup in lieu of the soy sauce to the mushrooms really gives it a thicker and much tastier sauce. Fresh mushrooms cooked in butter up the flavor as well.
5,The soy sauce was not something I would have thought to add but it certainly gives the mushrooms that savory flavor. Yum! I also add garlic butter to my buns before I laid them on the skillet I&apos;d just cooked the mushrooms in. I love Red Robin&apos;s mushroom Swiss burger and this came super close for a fraction of the cost of eating it at the restaurant. Thank you!
5,These were wonderful! I used ground chuck and fresh mushrooms. So so good! Next time I may use a lower sodium soy sauce! I will def. make these again!!!
4,This was a nice change! I added extra seasonings and garlic to the burger mix though. Loved the mushrooms with the soy sauce! I even added onions.......Mmmmmmm!:o)
5,Instead of soy sauce i used a dash of balsamic vinegar in the mushrooms and meat.
5,"I&apos;m surprised this recipe doesn&apos;t have more rave reviews. This was easy, the ingredients readily available, and delicious! Made it exactly as written for our 4th of July picnic. I used a rolling pin (wrapped in parchment paper to prevent sticking) to ensure even thickness on the baking sheet. I cut it to the size of the Hawaiian bread rolls, using a pizza slicer. I topped it with American cheese and ketchup, pickles optional. I received so many compliments. Thank you for sharing this!"
5,"I have never left a review (even though I have read hundreds on this site to help me pick all my favorites).  But I felt it worthy to review this recipe since they are so amazing, so easy, and because there are not many reviews already.  These sliders were so easy to whip together and my very picky husband and children flipped over them.  I did not change a thing.  I will definitely be making these again.  I&apos;m already thinking about how perfect they&apos;ll be for the Superbowl party.  Thank You!"
5,"3.21.18  I grew up in the Midwest, where we called White Castles®  belly bombers, and I ate my share of them!  I mixed up the beef, put half of it in the freezer, and made 12 burgers today.  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and put down a layer of finely chopped onions beneath the big burger patty (would recommend you try this) because that’s how they’re cooked on the grill (no beef broth as was suggested), used a straw to poke ventilation holes in the big patty, and cut them to fit the bun with a pizza cutter.  The one thing that was omitted from this recipe was a dill pickle slice for each burger, it&apos;s important;  as I recall, that’s something they always had.  The only thing that would bring this recipe closer to the real deal (other than having that little cardboard box), is to steam the buns, they need to be softer, and I will try that  the next time.  Had some burgers left today which I wrapped up individually in plastic wrap,  then into the freezer to be reheated at a low temp in the microwave.  Please, no American cheese or Dusseldorf mustard, just a plain White Castle®, the way they always were sold (and yes, I remember when they were 12-15¢).  Gotta tell ya, an indulgence for sure, but I totally enjoyed this, it was like a  "" blast from the past!""  ***UPDATE 6.2.18:  Today, I  steamed the  finished burger, and OMG, now they’re the real deal!"
5,"Quick, easy, and delicious! They taste just like White Castle sliders (if not better). The recipe worked with just 1lb of 90/10 ground beef. We also sauteed half a diced sweet onion (EVO/salt/pep) and smeared that  on top of the beef after 10m, then layered the whole thing with &apos;Murican cheese slices and cooked it another 5m. We didn&apos;t have pickle slices but relish works just as well. We sliced it w/ a pizza slicer. Yeahhhh boiii."
5,We are calling them homemade Krystal burgers. I made them for Girls&apos; Night Out and didn&apos;t make it out the door without my husband snagging a few. My friends were surprised to find out I hadn&apos;t gotten them at the drive through. That first time I followed the recipe precisely. Changing it too much defeats the purpose anyway right? The next time I used ground sirloin instead of chuck to reduce the fat and nicer rolls. Do use a larger cookie sheet than called for and roll the meat all the way to the edges. If it sticks to the side a little it will reduce shrinkage. Also if you can slice the rolls all in one piece you can put on a slab of meat and top it all with cheese at once. Cutting the rolls apart afterward is easier than making two dozen individual burgers.
3,"@ TWITCH RADIO: The information in your comment comment is completely incorrect. White Castle was the first fast-food hamburger system ever developed, starting in 1921 by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson. Krystal restaurants didn&apos;t start until 1932, over 10 years after White Castle, the basic idea being copied from the White Castle system after a visit to a White Castle location by Rody Davenport, Jr., and J. Glenn Sherrill, the founders of Krystal. The two systems are only similar in the certain appearance aspects of the finished hamburger. The cooking methods are entirely different, being that the White Castle hamburger patty is steam cooked on a bed of onions and water, and is never flipped; while the Krystal is fried and flipped halfway through the cooking process. White Castle is THE FIRST AND ORIGINAL fast-food system. The two companies are completely unrelated. May I suggest that you please get your fact straight before you publish erroneous, potentially scurrilous information here that only propagates rumors and muddies the waters for folks who don&apos;t know the true story. It is irresponsible comments like yours that further untrue stories about the quality and of fast-food restaurants and other businesses."
5,OMG so amazing! I used 2 lbs of ground turkey and cooked for 15 minutes. I served on wheat Hawaiian rolls. I have already shared the recipe with many of my co-workers. Thank you so much for sharing.
5,This turned out great! I used onion powder instead of onion soup mix added Worcester sauce & they turned out better than I thought they would. They taste just like White Castle burgers & were incredible easy. After mixing everything in a bowl I placed it in a pan covered it in parchment paper and used a rolling pin to flatten it evenly. I cooked it on non-stick Reynolds wrap. Cooking took maybe 15 minutes at 400 with less mess than trying to cook them stovetop. After draining & scraping off the &apos;goo&apos; I just added cheese on top popped them in the microwave to melt the cheese & placed them on buttered toast with melted shredded mozzarella cheese on the toast as I had no buns but it was still really good. I think they would be great with Hawaiian rolls.
5,These were really good. I chopped the pickles with some vadalia onion. I used a kitchen shears to cut up the sheet of burgers to the right size. I made 24 for 5 people and they disappeared. in minutes! I will be making these again for a crowd....but this time I will make a lot more! Thanks for the recipe!
5,"Fixed this tonite as a hamburger steak & served with 4 cheese rice for hubby, cottage cheese for me & pickled beets for both.  Broiled the patties in the convection oven.  It turned out great & we both loved it.  Also, the meal was very kind to my diabetes.  Will be sure to have it again."
4,These made for yummy hamburgers...just not the juiciest hamburgers ever.
4,I ended up marinating these for an hour. We really like the flavor but they weren&apos;t any juicier than reg burgers.
3,"These were just ok for me. They were not any juicer than my regular burgers, and I didn&apos;t really notice any special flavor in them other than just a hint of the beer. Thanks."
3,"The burgers are very good but they tend to fall apart on the grill.  Rather than marinade them in the juice mixture, I added 1/4 cup of it to the beef and added a slightly beaten egg and some bread crumbs to keep them together on the grill."
5,"This is my favorite hamburger recipe by far. The flaver is really great. I haven&apos;t grilled these yet but I&apos;m sure they&apos;ll be great then too. 
                                Edit - I have made this at least five times since my previous review and have made other hamburger recipes. This is still the best, haven&apos;t even tweaked the recipe!"
3,"Made as per recipe, we found no improvement in juciness or flavor over our usual burgers, so I added the leftover marinade to more ground beef, formed patties and chilled for about an hour.  These were somewhat more moist and had more flavor, but still didn&apos;t impress.  Thank you anyway Caliboo."
4,Real good and I thought they were juicy.  I used onion powder instead of onion salt and added just a pinch of regular salt.
3,"With all the rave reviews, I thought this would be much better than what my family ate. I think it&apos;s because I didn&apos;t use the onion salt and used some chopped onion instead, which made the burger not seasoned enough. I&apos;ll definitely make sure I generously season next time. However, they were indeed very juicy!"
4,The burgers were moist and had a nice flavor but next time I will probably only use half the amount of liquid smoke.  It seemed a little over powering but maybe it&apos;s because I have not used it in very many recipes.  Thanks...it was a nice change from the regular grilled burgers.
4,The recipe is simple and made my burgers turn out juicy and delicious. I would an egg to make to burgers stick better but overall it was fantastic.
5,The best hamburgers ever!  Sometimes I add 1/2 tsp of Montreal Steak seasoning to add some zip.  But I got rave reviews from family on this one.  Thanks for the recipe.
5,"These were soooo good.  I only used a 1/2 tablespoon of liquid smoke, and I&apos;m glad I did because I think it would&apos;ve been overpowering otherwise.  I also used 1 clove fresh garlic instead of powder."
5,Definitely lives up to it&apos;s name! These are some of the best burgers we&apos;ve tried on this site to date. We loved the smoky BBQ taste the liquid smoke gave these. I used the whole tablespoon and it wasn&apos;t overpowering. If you don&apos;t like liquid smoke this isn&apos;t your burger. There&apos;s no need to rub with oil or seasoned salt. We used 85/15 burger meat. UPDATE: We&apos;ve had so many requests for this recipe that we&apos;ve even had to scale these up to 48 for our own July 4th party and bring these to other people&apos;s BBQ&apos;s instead of the regularly requested pasta or potato salad!!!
5,"These burgers were very easy, and VERY tasty! Didn&apos;t have garlic powder, so I used onion powder.  Also, I mixed in the oil and seasoned salt with the meat rather than coating the outside of the patty. I topped mine with a slice of provolone cheese before taking off the grill.  YUMMY!"
4,"I had 4lbs of burger, and found this recipe appealing as well as ""Juiciest Hamburgers Ever"" by Jane.  I doubled this one and combined it with the other recipe which called for 2 lbs of hamburger.  Excellent combo."
5,These burgers were a hit! I broiled them in my oven but it tasted like I grilled them outdoors!
4,Great recipe for hamburgers. I grilled these on an indoor grill. It gave it a very smoky/bbq-ish flavor. Nice juicy burger. I will make these again next burger night.
3,Added about 1 tble BBQ sauce. Used only 1/2 tble of liquid smoke and only a 1/2 tea garlic powder. Also I take the burgers out of the refrigerator about a half hour before grilling.
5,"We LOVED this! I made single burgers (Mac Jr.&apos;s), and quartered the sauce recipe, which was the perfect amount for 5 burgers.  Also, I made my patties about 4 ounces each b/c I was only making singles. The family flipped over these...they really did taste just like a Big Mac! I will def be making these again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)"
5,"Hubby declared the sauce to be spot on.  That said, the recipe makes enough sauce for dozens of burgers, not just two.  I cut the sauce in half and still.....  it&apos;s a LOT of sauce.  
                                I did make my burger patties bigger than instructed, but I couldn&apos;t help myself.   2/3 lbs for 4 patties is probably about what McD&apos;s would serve."
5,I doubled the recipe and made 8 patties out of 2 full pounds of beef. I cut the sauce recipe in half. These were great! I will be making them again.
4,To be honest I just made the the sauce to put on some sliders. The sauce came out great and I&apos;ve reused this recipe numerous times.
1,This does not taste like Big Mac Sauce. We eat enough Big Macs in this household to know the difference. I ve yet to find a recipe that is anywhere near tasting like the actual sauce.
5,How could I not make this immediately?!?! Easy peasy with the most difficult part being the small mince of the onions. Everything I needed was already in the house! A couple of ice cold Cokes added and my husband and son were in heaven!
5,It  was good but make sure the patties are thin if u make them anywhere near regular size patties I&apos;d suggest no second middle bun way too much on meat Sauce was great
5,Only used the recipe for the sauce and it was def spot on took me back to when I was a kid and we used to go to McDonald&apos;s when nobody wanted to cook I did a mcsingle lol just the one patty sauce some lettuce and used my homemade hot sauce def will be using again
5,"Loved it! Im in New Zealand. I made the patties with some breadcrumbs and an egg to bind it and I put some american mustard in the pattie too. I needed to make them even thinner then 5mm when uncooked and wider than the bun (I made them the same size and they shrunk!)  I could not find ""dill pickles"" at the supermarket - found out they are called gherkins here! and there was no pickle relish so I just blended some gherkins and it worked. The sauce is AMAZING!!! so nice to have maccas in lockdown- my partner has not been coping with level 4 restrictions!"
5,"NO NEED FOR KETCHUP OR MUSTARD HERE! BURGERS POP WITH FLAVOR! DON&apos;T TRY IT WITHOUT REAL CHOPPED ONION BITS, BECAUSE YOU&apos;RE MISSING OUT!
                                
                                This recipe tastes absolutely amazing and juicy even with extra lean ground beef, but I suggest some minor modifications. 
                                
                                1) I recommend using double the amount of ranch suggested in this recipe. Others have noted and I have found as well that it is difficult to taste without adding alot more.
                                
                                2) Don&apos;t use as much crackers, just buy leaner beef. The crackers are just filler and detract from the recipe and tend to dry out the meat. I suggest using about 1/2 to 3/4 of the suggested amount of saltines."
5,I LOVE good burgers!!!I made these a few weeks ago and we love them! I did change a few things. Just two of us so I used 1 pound of burger and made two BIG burgers! I used a whole pack of Ranch dressing mix and instead of raw onion I used 1/2 pack of onion soup mix. I used Italian bread crumbs in place of cracker crumbs. Very much full of flavor and moist. I made it in the morning and grilled for dinner. The flavor really goes thru. I made a batch this morning and cant wait for dinner tonight! This is a keeper for us!
3,I did not like this recipe at all. I think one of the previous reviews was correct. It tasted like meatloaf. With all of those crackers I did not taste the ranch at all. Next time I will make them with just the meat and the ranch seasoning. I am sure that this would be a better combination.
5,Leave out the crackers and egg and just add onion soup mix with the ranch package. To die for hamburgers...Used my mother-in-laws homemade barbeque sauce. Smells wonderful while cooking. Hubby took to work and everyone wanted to sample.
5,Original review--April 24 2009: Pretty good. I used the Dry Ranch Dressing mix from this site (minus the salt and adding dill) and crushed Ritz crackers instead of saltines. I served them up with a nice sharp cheddar and slices of tomato. EDITED: These are NOT gross. I make these at least once every couple months in a variety of ways. One of my favorite ways to make it is serve it with a doctored up cream-of-mushroom soup gravy and fluffy mashed potatoes. My family LOVES it. This also works with ground turkey or ground chicken. I highly suggest making your own homemade ranch dressing mix if you can. It makes it SO much better.
1,I made these for dinner tonight and my family ended up eating cereal. These burgers were not good at all and we threw them away. They tasted liked mushy meatloaf on a bun. My husband couldn&apos;t even finish his which never happens. Sorry but I don&apos;t understand the high scores this recipe got.
5,Great burgers! After going through the reviews - use 1 oz. dry ranch mix for every pound of ground beef. I used 1 lb. of 85/15 ground beef and added 1 tsp. of dried minced onion and 1/2 tsp. of onion powder. There really was no need for the egg or cracker/bread crumbs. These came out very moist. Next time I will reserve a little of the dry ranch mix and add it to some mayo for a topping.
5,One of the best burger recipes I have found to date.  I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of saltines...all I had on hand.  The burgers came out moist and had tons of flavor...you don&apos;t even need condiments for this...leave the meat alone.  We added some bacon and the cheese of our choice....and wow.  Will definately make this one again. Thanks for the post.
5,I did everything just like the recipe said and it was wonderful...NO modifying!! That is always annoying to me.
4,"These burgers were so delicious 
                                Thank you for the recipe
                                Only thing I’ll do different next time is cut back on the mustard"
4,They didn&apos;t hold up very well but had good flavor with staple ingredients. Seemed kinda oily to myself.
5,"We loved these burgers. I did add an egg, hickory smoked salt and smoky bbq sauce instead of ketchup"
4,"Not a horseradish fan, so I left it out. I left everything else exactly the same but I added an egg since one or two people said the burger fell apart while cooking. I also think a key to holding it together is keeping it cold until you are ready to cook it.  It was really a good burger and moist too."
5,"I wish I could give this one 6 stars.  Very well done.  For my own personal taste, I will add more horeradish next time.  The flavor really melded together well.  I had no problem in the burger staying together.  Also, I fried them on top of the stove and they turned out fantastic."
5,"Update:  Made these again last night and added 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke, 2 glugs of A1 and 1 T of the horseradish (DH said go ahead).  Even DH could not taste the horseradish, so I&apos;ll definately add the whole 2 T next time.  Man were these good!  Original: These are gonna be so great at the lake this summer!  Was so excited to try the horseradish, was going to make half without for DH and half with for me, & I forgot to add it to mine.  They were still wonderful! Can&apos;t wait to make them again w/the horseradish."
5,i am a professional caterer by trade. i opted to cook some rice in beef stock and add the cooked rice to my mix. they were so flavorful def one of my fav. red meat recipes!!!amazing burger!
5,"I made this for dinner tonight and my red meat loving husband said it was the best hamburger he&apos;s ever had! They were juicy with just a hint of bacon. I did add an egg, with splashes of wostershire, A1, and Liquid Smoke, with slice cheese on top. This is the ONLY hamburger recipe i&apos;ll use from now on!"
4,Great burger! My husband loves bacon and cheddar so I had to give these a try. I cut the amount of horseradish in half because I was topping these with a horseradish sauce. I added 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke and had no trouble with these holding together. I got three really nice patties. These were delicious on toasted rolls - YUM!
5,"My husband loves burgers, I&apos;m not a huge fan, but we both loved these ones!  I served this with additional extra sharp cheddar on top and didn&apos;t change anything in the recipe.  The burgers were moist and very flavourful."
5,I absolutely love these hamburgers and we eat them all the time. They are so easy to make and they are bursting with flavor! I like to add even more horseradish then is called for and I always throw an extra handful of cheese in for good measure!
5,I&apos;m not usually a hamburger person but I really liked these. They were very moist and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except that I cut down the horseradish a bit. Next time I&apos;ll use the full amount: while it smells strong in the raw burgers it wasn&apos;t at all overpowering. Also- left the meat (90/10) in the fridge until the last minute and the burgers stayed together nicely while grilling.
3,Very good! I also cook them in a black iron skillet in the stove.
5,"I made this twice, the first time with the egg and the second time without and I definately reccomend leaving the egg out if you don&apos;t want the meatloaf texture!  It tasted great and will be making it again!"
5,"A truly excellent take on the standard burger-on-a-grill. I won&apos;t bother with the telling you what I added or subtracted... most grillers have their own ""special"" ingredients that they swear by...
                                I&apos;ll mention two things that seem to be a recurring theme. One is cooking the bacon and the burger together. This is caused by the thickness of the bacon, and the heat of the grill. If you&apos;re using standard grocery-store bacon, then you&apos;re probably fine with a high-heat grill; however, if you&apos;re working with a thick slab bacon, you might want to slightly lower the grill temperature and give the burger time to catch up with the bacon...
                                
                                The other issue is how the burgers hold up on the grill., and this is partially due to the binding proteins in the egg. If you&apos;re following the recipe and using 1 lb of hamburger, then only use 1/2 an egg. Once you&apos;ve got it mixed in, form into patties, and let rest (covered) in the refrigerator for at least an hour... longer, if you have the time.
                                Even so, they&apos;re still a bit tender on the grill, so make sure that you preheat the grill, then scrape the grill with a wire brush. Finally, put some veggie oil on a paper towel, and rub down the grill, just before cooking. This should keep the grill slick, and reduce the chance of them breaking apart.
                                With the exception of reducing the egg by 1/2, I would strongly recommend that you try this recipe, as written. Even if you&apos;re not of fan of onions, you just might be surprised at what you taste... keep the"
5,I dont know what JVDMD did wrong but these burgers are absolutely fantastic! I made them for a dinner at our annual cottage family reunion and they were a huge success!! Everyone raved and every last burger was devoured. Even my aunt who eats nothing ate THREE!! They were honestly the best burger I have ever eaten at home or at a restaurant. I must admit I did make a couple changes but that was only to suit the tastes of my family (We LOVE garlic). I was using about 6lbs of groundbeef so to the recipe I added 3 cloves of garlic a dash of Clubhouse Garlic Plus seasoning and a dash of oregano. I added less Worcestershire sauce and omitted the ketchup instead adding a spicy bbq sauce (exact amount unknown but greater than the amount of ketchup called for). I also left out the Parmesan and added extra cheddar onion and black pepper. Once again these are the most delicious burgers!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!! _
4,"Juicy, but the burgers have to be handled with care.  To ensure crispy bacon, cook it to soft stage before using on the burgers.  This also helps reduce the amount of flare-ups from excess bacon grease."
5,"My boyfriend and I loved these! I chose to cook them in a skillet though, as I was afraid the bacon would stick to the grill or fall off. I wrapped them from top to bottom, rather than around the sides. Frying them slowly made the  bacon come out just right, and the meat cooked through. I put Swiss cheese on them, with dijon mustard and mayo...YUM!! Will definately make again!"
5,I loved these. A lot of people wrote that the bacon took too long to cook. We did not have that problem. I just bought some cheap bacon from Aldi and it worked great. Plus my husband laughed at making 6 burgers from a pound of meat. He made 3 burgers instead and really they were perfect size. Great recipe!
5,May sound crazy - but I make these with cream cheese instead of cheddar and/or parmasean bread crumbs and more pepper! I mix up the meat without the cheese roll into ball and burrow a teaspoon or so of cream cheese into ball flatten out into patty wrap the bacon and grill! Juicy & Yum Yum Yum!!
3,Juicy it is but the burger does not hold together well and the bacon does not get very done standing on edge like that. Need to adjust the recipe to discard the bacon after the burger is cooked and do something to make the meat hold together better.
5,These are fabulous! Word of CAUTION: Do you have a water bottle nearby for flames/flare-ups from bacon grease. These are the juicest burgers ever! I think I will put some foil down & poke holes in it next time...
5,Very tasty! My family and Superbowl guest loved these! Quick receipe and perfect hand food for parties. I will definitely  be making these again.
3,5.14.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/277748/cheeseburger-sliders/ ... &apos;Decreased butter to 2T. It was enough. &apos;Liked; didn&apos;t wow anyone.
4,"Very yummy and enjoyed by the family. My daughter said she didn’t like the mustard taste and preferred my regular slider recipe to these, but still ate them. Easy and quick."
5,My family absolutely LOVED these sliders I will have to triple the recipe next time!!!
5,Made it just as written.......delicious.
5,Yes all the way to these!!!!!! I did add sliced pickles but that was my only change. Super yummy and the fam LOVED them! Thanks for sharing
5,"Delicious!  Definitely a keeper, everyone loved them.  The only change I made was only using half of the called-for amount of butter topping.  I&apos;m sure the fall amount would have been good too, but it seemed like overkill."
5,"Did the recipe as stated, loved it. Perfect size for little hands."
4,I thought the flavor was delicious and worked great with the sweet Hawaiian rolls.  Next time I would leave the brown sugar out of the butter.  It made it a little too sweet for me
3,"This is good for a basic slider but the true secret to a Super Slider is putting a dollop (approx. 1/2 tbsp) of butter in the center of the patty before cooking.  I also season mine with McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of just salt & pepper.  Use King&apos;s Hawaiian Sweet Rolls for your buns, you won&apos;t regret it!"
5,These were a hit and it was the &apos;secret sauce&apos; that put these over the top! I toasted the buns and added a little cheese. I plan to make these again and I&apos;ll be using the sauce often YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)
4,Love the sauce! I used dill relish instead of sweet. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic and a dash of dale sauce and a pkg of lipton onion soup mix to the hamburger. Then reshaped it so I could cut it into 8 even pieces. I&apos;ll have to make more of the sauce next time because we used it to dip our fries too! We like our burger done completely and it took significantly longer than 4 minutes on each side. I used a thermometer to tell when they hit 165 degrees. This was perfect for our family.
5,I always love Chef John&apos;s recipes so I thought I would use ths one as a jumping off point. I decided I wanted to kick it up a notch. I substituted Johnsonville Italian sausage for the ground beef.Topped it with provolone. I sauteed some mini bell peppers for my topper. I also mixed diced sundried tomatoes into mayo for my secret sauce. My hubby says they are the best sliders he has ever had.
5,"awesome! the sauce is great too. but I divided the meat and put it into cheap baggies to press into patties; no mess that way. They&apos;re thinner and cook faster. Easier to eat too don&apos;t have to unhinge your jaw to bite it. ""and as always enjoy!"""
5,"We thought these were fantastic burgers. I know this sounds like a standard recipe but it is so much better for reasons I cannot explain. I used kosher salt and freshly ground pepper and subbed the tomato for chipotle bread & butter pickle since it&apos;s what I had on hand. I have been making burgers for years with these same ingredients but there is something special in here that makes these great. I made a comment while eating how good these were and my husband said, ""I was just going to say that"". The 3 minute time was was too rare for me but my husband liked them. I cooked mine a little longer. Maybe it was the special sauce, maybe it was the hotter pan than I usually use, but do try this. Thanks Chef John! These were fantastic."
4,"Great base recipe, but I needed more flavor.  So I made a few simple changes:
                                First: I seasoned my beef before cooking by adding chopped garlic.
                                Second: I added one part Blazin&apos; Burger seasoning to the dressing.
                                Third: I used Hawaiian Sweet Bread dinner rolls, and topped each burger with a small piece of pineapple, and a slice of jalapeno.
                                *Alternative dressing is sweet chili sauce; adjusting the heat with hot pepper flakes.
                                This was &apos;ONO (which means DELICIOUS in Hawaiian)!!"
5,I followed the method of using a muffin pan to make the patties but used a large muffin size (6 cup pan) instead of regular size. I prepared the beef using the Juiciest Hamburgers Ever recipe. 2 pounds of beef made 28 mini-burgers to put on Hawaiian rolls (24-pk) using 2 mini cookie dough scoops each so all were the same size cooked them for 4-5 min per side and topped with a slice of manchego cheese and black forest ham a slice of tomato and the secret sauce yum! We all loved these thank you Chef!
5,loved the sauce too!
5,I have to admit I give these 5 stars because this is my recipe! My original recipe calls for cubing the cheese not shredding it so it&apos;s your call. Enjoy:-) UPDATE: Ramon wanted to know how I serve these--I like ranch dressing on mine my husband prefers Cholula hot sauce on his and the kids put ketchup on theirs--I have also made these with cooked crumbled bacon inside but you can do whatever you want! I usually do use more garlic in mine too but most people don&apos;t like a lot of garlic so I toned it down for this recipe.
5,I made these burgers for our tailgating party and they were a HUGE hit!! my husband and his friends loved them so much that I now have to make them every Sunday!! I used double the garlic and sweet onions instead of red. Thanks for the great recipe!!!
3,"I was trying to figure out if I liked these or not when my husband looked at me and said ""These taste a little like meatloaf don&apos;t they"" - and he was right. I guess it was the combination of garlic sausage egg and the cheese turned it from a hamburger into a meatloaf type burger. It tasted good just not what we were expecting...I topped with steak sauce lettuce tomato onion and pickles - maybe if we had used BBQ sauce. Thank you so much for recipe...."
5,Fantastic burgers I would love to hear from the author how he serves them:Mayo mustard bacon etc. etc.!!! Thanks a lot Ramon
4,we really enjoyed these burgers.. unfortunately it&apos;s way too hot to be outside grilling so we just pan fried them.. im sure grilling is the way to go with these burgers for that smokey component.. so always using what we have on hand we made the following modifications.. ground turkey for the ground beef.. provolone for the muenster.. and deveined/seeded jalapeno for the anaheim chiles.. scaled this down to two patties so we left out the egg.. we couldn&apos;t really detect the chili powder and bf ate his with tabasco sauce.. either way it was tasty.. ty for the recipe
4,Excellent burgers! We may add some jalepenos next time otherwise made just as written & they turned out great! Thanks for posting!
5,These burgers were to die for! I made them for a family BBQ they were such a big hit that I will make them every time we grill out.
5,"I made these at my recent 50th birthday party with 40-50 family members attending.  I had regular and gourmet burgers on the grill, and noboby wanted the regular, it was gourmet all the way until they were gone.  Several people asked me what the ingredients were, and where I got the recipe from.  Definitely a hit.
                                
                                Quick note, I didn&apos;t have any Italian Sausage, so I just made everything with ground beef.  I will be making these often, so i&apos;ll add the Italian Sausage next time."
5,My husband and I made them and loved them! I think if you put too much egg in there it could taste a little bit like meatloaf. Maybe more worcestershire sauce and less egg but we loved them just as it was and didn t have a bun nor did we put anything on top. We ate it with a salad.
5,I&apos;ve been making burgers this way for years and they&apos;ve always gotten compliments. I use Italian bread crumbs however in place of the oats and leave out the hot sauce (our personal tastes don&apos;t run to hot foods). I also add a couple of cloves of minced garlic and a tbsp of green relish to spice things up. It holds together nicely on the grill even when I make nice huge flat patties for those large buns. There is NO other way to make a burger!;-)
4,I wouldn&apos;t say it&apos;s the best burger ever but it&apos;s worth repeating! I&apos;m not a spice lover so I was a little concerned with the hot pepper sauce but I followed the recipe exactly and found that it added just a little zing. Very nice! Here&apos;s a tip I just learned and it worked out great. Put an indent in the middle of your patties with your thumb before cooking - then they&apos;ll come out flat and not bulging in the middle!
5,Great burgers! I added a pat of butter and inserted into the center of the patty before grilling make sure you close the meat around it. It adds so much flavor to burgers even in the oven grill.
5,THE FIRST TIME I MADE THESE: I left out the onion soup mix and egg and they were AWESOME! I&apos;m a huge fan of flat flat burgers. hate hate meatball burgers. well these were super flat and very tasty. my 3 kids ate them and never said a word about the hot sauce. it wasn&apos;t spicy like hot sauce it just made for a very tasty burger. also very moist. i will make these often. will probably add some extra garlic salt since we are very fond of garlic. we even garlic salt our french fries. yummy. thanks. THE SECOND TIME I MADE THESE: i used the onion soup mix and egg. they were still moist and flat but they tasted waaaay too much like meatloaf. no one liked them.
3,These were easy and tasted good. I cut the oats down to 1/2 cup.
3,These turned out pretty dry. Had to cop them up for the kids and serve it to them like meatloaf otherwise they wouldn&apos;t eat them. They were also surprisingly bland. If I make these again I will cut down on the oats and add pickle relish like another reviewer stated.
5,This was really good. I was a little skeptical of the oatmeal at first but it tasted wonderful. We made them for a grill out and I got nothing but compliments!
5,Excellent flavour!! I generally do not eat hamburgers but could not help myself in this case. I made a double recipe. The burgers were even better the next day reheated as the flavour became even better. A great make ahead meal.
5,Since we still have plenty of snow on the ground we were unable to grill these. Instead I made it into a meatloaf (still following the recipe exactly) that I cooked for 1 hour at 350. It was great. My BF loved it and said he liked it better than my regular meatloaf. I will try this again as burgers too!
4,"Pretty goo! I made a ""gyros"" sauce to go with it, too -- if you really like the ""gyros thing"" -- I suggest making this to go with it: Mix some plain yougart, light sour cream, fresh mint, garlic salt, chopped cucumber, scallions, and tomato together. Put this over your burger. Voila! Pretty good, if I do say so myself. :)"
5,"Very, very good.  The spice combination is spectacular. I put the mixture into my food processor to get a firmer texture.  I then shaped into a very thin loaf and broiled in the oven.  Slice very thinly and serve with pita, fried in olive oil, greek olives, roasted garlic and tzatziki sauce. Great appetizer."
5,It was really good. I have never been able to get that same taste like they have a those Gyros stands or greek restaurants till now. thanks
5,"these were very good.  I used 1.30 # ground sirloin only.  Did not have the savory.  Added 1/2 tsp. dried oregano as other reviewers suggested (thank you) and fresh chopped parsley to the mix.  Left out the bread crumbs because didn&apos;t use lamb which adds more liquid (oil) to the mix.  Was afraid they would be too dry using ground sirloin only.  They were not at all dry.  Mixed it up this afternoon and let it set for a few hours for the flavors to blend.  Tasted much like gyro meat.  Served in warmed onion pitas w/red onion slices, diced fresh tomatoes, and tziziki sauce.  Thanks LatinaCook for the photo submission, as well."
1,What sort of Greek restaurants are people eating at if they think this is even remotely authentic OR taste like gyros. I&apos;ve NEVER had problems with 5-star recipes. If our family disagrees about it being 5-stars... it still turned out to be a decent dish (just not our thing). Please consider a different Gyro recipe. I&apos;ll report back when I&apos;ve discovered a better one but this doesn&apos;t taste like gyros at all esp. if you&apos;re spoiled and have a good restaurant near you. I&apos;m VERY easy to please and my husband... not so much. Either way we both didn&apos;t want to eat this. Followed the recipe exactly and even included the sauce people recommended. FWIW the sauce tastes better w/o blending it. Blending it makes it too thin.
5,Very very good. Meat tasted just like traditional gyro meat it just didn&apos;t look like it. Will definitely make again. Made this with the Tzatziki Sauce I recipe (plus cucumber).
5,added some feta
5,Outstanding! I pretty much followed the recipe except I used all beef and pressed some onion into the meat mixture. I also cut the patties as suggested by a previous reviewer and served on flatbread with red onion tomato lettuce and tzatziki. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!
4,Pretty good. I couldn&apos;t find savory anywhere though. I grilled the patties on my foreman grill and i cut them in 4-5 slices each before putting them in the pita bread. (I used the tzatziki I sauce from this site and added 1/2 cucumber to it for a more authentic flavor).
5,Very good
5,I made this the other night and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. I used a jar of mild sliced jalapenos and a container of chive and onion cream cheese. We threw the cream cheese meat and jalapenos in a Kitchen Aid mixer and mixed it up until it was all nice and pink. This broke up the jalapenos a bit. We were a little concerned that the meat being mixed so much wouldn&apos;t patty well or hold together but we were wrong. Mixing it a lot also gave the burgers a really great light texture that brought out the flavors. We didn&apos;t have a grill at the time so we cooked the burgers in a skillet and they came out great. We wished we hadn&apos;t scaled down the recipe so we would have lots of left-overs.
4,"These burgers Are GREAT!!! I would recommend putting the cream cheese in the middle. I tryed both ways, mixing and stuffing the burgers. There IS a taste differance. Mixing it together was like eating a meatloaf burger, putting the stuffing in the middle made for a tastier burger. RECOMMEND BACON!!!"
4,This tastes amazing! The only thing I found was using mustard ketchup relish etc. with these kind of took away from the cream cheese flavour. I would maybe just use a bit of mayo and veggies (lettuce tomato onion) and try to stay away from any over powering condiments/sauces.
5,Okay these were AWESOME....with a few changes. I added only about 1 1/2 cups of FINELY diced jalapeno (seeds and membranes removed) along with the 8 oz block of softened cream cheese. Then I just mixed the mixture into the meat and made patties. We then grilled on a well-oiled grill. They turned out great! Next time we plan to top them with bacon...YUM!
5,"This is the only way I&apos;ll be making my burgers from now on! If you like jalapeño poppers, you&apos;ll LOVE this! I chopped up jalapeños that were in a jar (all that I had) and mixed that into the meat. Then took regular cream cheese and spread a good amount onto the burger. It was FANTASTIC! I can&apos;t believe no restaurants have this type of burger. Could definitely serve this in a restaurant and it&apos;d be a hit!"
5,These were great! We followed the advice of one reviewer who suggested mixing the cream cheese and jalepenos into the burger. Next time we won&apos;t mix all of the cream cheese as the patties didn&apos;t hold together very well but will save some cream cheese to melt on the top. The flavor and texture was incredible thought!
3,Good flavor but the recipe as written is too messy. I&apos;ve made this twice and for the life of me can&apos;t get the burgers to hold together with the cream cheese stuffed in the middle. I recommend using the jalapeno cream cheese as a spread on the bun instead.
5,Holy Hamburger Heaven! Need I say more? I too mixed only 1 pkg of herb and garlic cream cheese right into the meat.
4,we really enjoyed this recipe. i love cream cheese in everything. i made a few (wonderful) changes. the biggest and my favorite was to add canned black beans (about 1/2 can) to the meat mixture. i wanted a little more flavor and moisture and the beans made the meat so moist and extra meaty if that&apos;s possible. i also used much less jalapeno and also added fresh tomato to the cream cheese mixture. cooked these under the broiler and they were awesome. my boyfriend went back for seconds.
5,These lamb burgers are the perfect combination of easy-with-wow factor and great for a group. It&apos;s worth the time to make the simple yogurt sauce to go with it but I&apos;ve used store-bought Tzatziki in a pinch too. Also I love these with caramelized sweet onions and regular tomatoes on top but what a great way to use all those green tomatoes! Fantastic recipe as is!
5,This recipe has been a favorite of our Make-Ahead Mamas cooking group for over three years. We make it every summer during our Summer Grilling Cooking Party and it&apos;s a great gourmet alternative to a traditional hamburgers for your next BBQ. To save time the day of your BBQ make these ahead of time! Simply freeze the uncooked patties in a single layer on parchment paper on a cookie sheet then stack the frozen patties in a freezer container or Ziploc Freezer bag. Thaw the day before your party or cook the patties directly from the freezer (just add a few more minutes to the cooking time!). Delicious!
5,This was wonderful! Didn&apos;t alter any of the directions/ingredients and it turned out fabulously. My husband was just raving about these will make it again!
5,Loved these they were so easy and taste so good! Thank you!
5,We never had lamb burgers before and we loved this recipe. I did alter it though. I omitted the mint and used chive and I the juice of 1/2 lemon into the meat. Moist and delicious. For the sauce I subbed sour cream for the yogurt as that is what I had on hand and I added chopped cucumber the rest of the lemon juice and the garlic. We didn&apos;t have sliced feta so we used crumbled on the bottom of the bun and put our burgers on top of the feta. My kids just loved these burgers!
5,These were tremendous beautiful and deep flavours. I chose to not stuff them as I wanted nice flat burgers and they tend to round out in my opinion when stuffed. I simply added the cheese paste to the top of the burgers on the grill turned out amazing. Used the Bobby Flay indented burger tops as well and came out with perfectly big flat 1/3 lb burgers! Making them again tonight and thought I would drop a line.
4,Good
5,They were so good. I&apos;m making them again. I might try roasting the garlic that goes in the sauce first. They came out great. Also thought sliced cucumbers and grilled onions were good options on top.
5,Very workable will do again. I did double the garlic ( loves me garlic ) and used a crusty baguette ( see pic )
3,I don&apos;t think I care for lamb
5,"Way less salt and pepper, no cayenne
                                Italian breadcrumbs, (I had no dried thyme)
                                No bacon, simply as we&apos;d had bacon for breakfast same day
                                Pan fried.
                                Moist, tasty, and different.  
                                Will make again."
5,Love meatloaf and this looks awesome. Been trying to find a way to grill meatloaf. Thanks John!
5,I made it but broiled the burgers instead  it had a great flavor!!!!
5,"I&apos;m not one to toot my own horn, but these were the best burgers I think I&apos;ve made, ever!  Granted I don&apos;t make hamburgers often, but this recipe was a huge hit!  My only changes: 
                                
                                1. I used Ancho Chili Powder instead of Cayenne 
                                2. Crushed saltine crackers instead of breadcrumbs
                                3. Ground thyme
                                4. Extra Worscester 
                                
                                Thanks Chef John for a yummy recipe!"
5,I used half the salt but otherwise no changes. Absolutely delicious!!
5,Love them I didn&apos;t use the thyme though
5,"Boy what a hit! So easy to make but so flavorful. I came home from work with nothing to eat. I had bought some hamburger meat a day or two ago and I thought I would do something different with it than ""just a burger"". Of course when I found Chef John&apos;s recipe I knew it would be good! I was able to put it together quickly and served it to my wife (who is not a meatloaf fan) and son. It was a smash hit. Thanks for making me look good."
5,These were so yummy! I only used 1/4 tsp of salt and it was perfect.
5,On yeah! I will make this again for sure.
3,Also used jalapeno ketchup for extra heat.....guess I will have to try again because it was just a pretty ordinary burger to me.
5,Thank you Chef John! This was a great success tripled the recipe. Made 36 sandwiches for a gathering of friends. Nothing but compliments and directions to the Allrecipes website. Cooked the meat and onions the night before. Also prepared the bread. Brought the mixture to room temperature before adding the remaining ingredients the next morning. Prepared the sandwiches before the guests arrived covering with plastic wrap and refrigerating. Judged when we may like to eat slipped away and preheated the oven. With short baking time everyone was able to enjoy a warm sandwich.
5,I had most of the ingredients for this leftover in the fridge. Threw it together quickly and topped some toasted sourdough bread with the meat mixture.  Covered that with cheese and melted it in the oven. DELISH!! Hubs and kiddos loved every bite. Thanks Chef John!!
5,"Awesome, my hubby said it was the best home-made sandwich ever! I followed directions as is, although I could only find an 8 oz block of provolone at the grocery...which seemed like plenty enough in the finished sandwich. A 1 lb steak made enough for 2-3 sandwiches on a regular bolillo/hoagie-size roll."
5,These are great and easy to make!
5,Excellent! It was hard for me to find the perfect sized rolls but used Costco mini dinner rolls and it came out great!
5,I liked this recipe before I even made it. That s a good start! Unfortunately I used a too strong provolone (Belgiosio). The provolone overwhelmed the ol taste buds. I will make again soon with a mild or medium cheddar. I did substitute with ciabatta rolls. Kudos!
3,This didn&apos;t do anything for us as far as enjoyment to eat. We thought about making some changes then decided to just make our Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches like we normally would. Nice idea for a change but I for sure want red peppers not pickled ones. The cream cheese didn&apos;t do anything for it either.
2,"Sorry, this didn’t come out anything like a Philly cheesesteak. I’ve gone through the recipe and followed it to a tee. When we ate it, it tasted heavily of cream cheese. Maybe a sharper cheese to mask-don’t know but we couldn’t finish it. I love cheesesteaks. Lived outside of Philly for 8 years and this is a miss in my opinion."
5,This was great! The only change I made was to use jarred banana peppers because I could not find pickled peppers. Yum!
5,One on my favourite soups loved it! Sorry it got eaten straight away so no photo:-)
5,"Delicious! I made a couple modifications: no mushrooms, added celery and a clove of garlic to the onion/leek/carrot sautee step. I didn&apos;t have potato starch so I substituted with gluten-free flour and added a heaping tsp of Old Bay seasoning for a bit of extra flavour."
4,"Good, but a little oily.  Next time I will cut the oil and butter amounts in half.   I also added thyme and celery salt for more flavor."
3,Lacking any real flavor. Nothing special.
4,I will make this again. The only thing I changed was I didn t have potato starch so I left that out. It was very good. Next time I will add some thyme and celery seed.
2,Its not flavorful
5,Yum Yum really loved these Had them on noodles as well as cauliflower rice
5,Made exactly as written except I had some leftover mozzarella cheese pearls that I stuffed in the center of these meatballs.  They turned out really well. Served with spaghetti and a Caesar salad. I think what sauce you use could make or break this (as with any similar recipe) so be sure and choose one you love. I used one I hadn’t tried before but next time I will use my favorite sauce and this will be my “go to” meatball recipe!
4,"I served these as meatball subs and it was really good! I’d maybe use more seasonings to add more flavor, but it was pretty good overall!"
5,So pleasantly surprised!  Very flavorful!  Only small change was that I used a full 32oz jar of Rao’s tomato basil sauce and only one can of diced tomatoes. Will definitely make again.
5,"Good old fashioned recipe which we usually baked in the oven.  I was happily surprised how it came out in the crock pot. The only thing I did different was not use tomato juice.  I mixed some canned tomato sauce with a carton of chicken broth.  Next time, I will season it up a little more to suit our tastes, maybe use spicy italian sausage instead of mild, but as written, this is very good.  We liked it! To the reviewer named punkin...the rice is wet because it was rinsed...not cooked.  Also, I did not use the water from the cooked cabbage.  I personally don&apos;t think it would add any significant flavor  but if you need more liquid in the pot, it&apos;s right there."
1,"To confused Punkin: wet refers to rinsed rice. Depends if you get whole long rice or cheaper version. Also big factor, many methods, times, ways to cook cabbage rolls. Stove top, shorter cook time needs longer time to soften rice. Ground pork (not Bob Evans type breakfast, spiced sausage) should be used. Don’t form very tight meatballs, to let rice expand. Paprika, 1 to 2 T. Mix in filling. Put bigger leaves on bottom of pot. No need at all to save cabbage water. If your V8 and tomatoes WITH juice don’t just cover rolls, add a little water to pot. Bring to just boil and then let simmer about two hours."
5,I&apos;m confused.  Can someone help??   The recipe ingredients call for uncooked rice but the instructions say &apos;stir in wet rice&apos;.... What is the reserved water from the cabbage used for??  Is it to cook the rice partially??  I&apos;m sure this will be delicious.....
4,"This is pretty much how we always made cabbage rolls and my family. The only addition would be, I put canned petite diced tomatoes in with the meat and rice mixture. And I always use Sacramento Tomato Juice  if you can find it. I pour it over the cabbage rolls before I bake them. It just adds a special flavor. Some brands of tomato juice and vegetable juice are too sweet for my taste. I really like the flavor you get from the Sacramento brand tomato juice. I make a big batch and freeze  the leftovers."
5,"Very much like our Slovakian grandmother made, although before cooking (oven, stove top or crockpot) we added a layer (1 1/2 cups or so) of sauerkraut on top. Delicious! Can add a little Caraway seed to the kraut too."
5,Excellent recipe. My changes included skipping the rice season meat with rosemary and thyme salt pepper and garlic. Put in slow cooker or electric frypan put small red potatoes around rollups cover with home canned stewed tomatoes or diced tomatoes. Add 1/2 jalapeño if you want a little heat. Your guests will be begging for more!
5,Yes I make  them all the time  I always  make my cabbage rolls  with som  ground cayenne  red pepper  to make  them  little spicy
4,"This is very good. I always add a teaspoon full of Allspice to my sauce. Its very subtle and delicious. People taste and say ""What is the mystery flavor? We love it!"""
5,Just delicious. Not one complaint...
5,So good! Most of my family doesn’t like it too hot so I omitted the cayenne pepper and I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced. Everyone had two helpings! I will definitely make again!
5,This chili was so simple to make and the family LOVED it! It did come out a tad thinner than I normally would like but I&apos;ll just add less beef broth to start next time and that should do the trick. I put this together the night before and that worked out great. I will def be making this again-yum! Thanks for sharing
4,Was easy to make and very tasty!
5,"Easy, savory, hearty, and forgiving if you’re a cook like me who doesn’t always have all the ingredients or seasonings. I’ve made this three times now and I’ve never had parsley.  I found this recipe by accident when I had stew meat but no carrots or potatoes.  Now I make this rather than stew. It has quickly become a family favorite."
4,Overall good. would halve the onion amount and increase the meat quantity next time.
5,Amazing flavor easy to make I got rave reviews when I made it for my party definitely make it again
5,"Awesome recipe, we have made it twice now! Second time around I just added more stew meat and doubled the recipe  highly recommend! Even my family loves it."
5,This recipe is easy and delicious!  Who could ask for anything more!?  The only thing I did differently was added a can of dark red kidney beans because I like more beans in my chili and I didn’t have another can of black beans.  But oh my gosh it is sooooo good!!!
5,Next time I would add a little less broth but other than that it was great! The whole family enjoyed it!
5,"Both my husband and I really enjoyed this! So easy to make! I used all unsweetened almond milk in place of half-and-half, maple syrup in place of brown sugar, and left the raisins out. This allowed me to have a ""plain"" oatmeal to divide up for the week,  and top with whatever fruits, nuts, coconut, spices, etc that I wanted for the day. Adding in some vanilla extract and a pinch of salt adds a nice flavor too! I do find with most slow cooker oats, that they rarely need more than 5-6 hours on low heat to be done--more than that and they can stick and burn. They also benefit from being stirred every so often. If you do that, you end up with a delicious, and generous amount of, steel cut oats that are so incredibly easy to make! Thank you for the recipe--I will make this often!"
4,"This tasted good, creamy and not too sweet. The problem was a lot of it stuck to the sides and bottom of the Crock Pot. Some of it was burned a little. Mine cooked just 10 minutes shy of 8 hours. Maybe adding more water would help."
5,"I used only almond milk and water. Three parts milk to two parts water. Then, one part steel cut oats. I think it cooked approx. four and a half hours on low. It was perfect! I&apos;m really pleased because I was so tired of making it every morning. By making it plain, I can add any topping that I&apos;m in the mood for. I have a really huge appetite in the mornings, so this makes enough for about four to five days for me!"
4,"Steel cut oats are better for you than rolled oats, but they take longer to cook. It was nice to wake up to a warm bowl of steel cut oatmeal. So  convenient!
                                I used almond milk and 1% milk. And I added 1/4 t salt.
                                The edges burned little. I just scooped from the middle. 
                                I will put in 2 sticks of cinnamon next time"
5,"To those wondering how long this lasts....if you let a layer of fat harden on top of the broth, this essentially ""seals"" the broth from air and it can last several weeks in the fridge. That said, I always use mine up well before then, or I put the extra in the freezer for up to 2-3 months.  If your broth isn&apos;t sealed with the fat layer, use within 5 days."
5,"This is so easy! I freeze carcasses from rotisserie chicken and make this about once a week. I store in Mason jars in the freezer, leaving an inch of headspace in the jars to allow for  expansion as it freezes. I will never buy store chicken broth again!!"
5,Easy since you don&apos;t have to mess with the veggies much.
5,I tweaked the recipe. According to what  ingredients I had. But came out great!
5,"Very good flavor.  A full recipe fits perfectly in a 1.5-Quart slow-cooker.  I used a heaping 1/2 cup of sugar (granulated sugar subsitute worked well, too).  Cooking on High for 1.5 hours worked best, stirring occasionally (2 hours made the pearls pretty mushy).  
                                
                                Using 2 egg yolks worked for me, and that&apos;s the QTY of yolks in the original video for this recipe.  The original also called for 2 Tablespoons of vanilla.  I love vanilla, so I use that amount. It will seem SOUPY even after you add the yolks and let it cook for 20-30 minutes - don&apos;t worry, because it will set up nicely after it cools and chills.
                                
                                Best tapioca recipe I&apos;ve ever found..........creamy, yummy comfort food!"
5,Made this as stated. I am not a tapioca fan but figured our littlest would love it. I was right he devoured it. I tried some and actually liked it also. It was very smooth and creamy. The tapioca was done perfectly and the texture was fabulous one of the reasons I didn&apos;t like it in the past. I also have a newer slow cooker but did not have any issues with it.
4,This recipe has great potential WITHOUT any changes. I had trouble because my slow cooker runs very hot. I tried cooking it on low and then warm and finally succumbed to high. It finally started thickening and I then over cooked it. I will continue to make it stovetop because I can&apos;t babysit my slowcooker. If you have one of the older crockpots I think this would work much better. It still is very tasty. BTW I am going to keep my eye out for an older and slower crockpot. I did serve this over a puddle of grand marnier and the orange liquer was a very nice addition. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe Meadowwood!
5,"Very good recipe. I have a 1 1/2 qt slow cooker and it was the perfect size.  It&apos;s not overly sweet and I liked that. Easy to make, smooth and delicious. I didn&apos;t make any changes."
5,We really like tapioca here so I doubled the recipe. Also I only had large pearl tapioca on hand. I soaked it overnight and it worked out fine. I did cook 3 hours on high before adding the egg yolk since it was such a large batch. I also like to use the egg whites beating them to a stiff peak with a little sugar. I folded these in 30-45 minutes after adding the yolks. (This was about how much time it took for the pudding to start to thicken.) You may have to wait longer for your tapioca by cooking it in the slow cooker but I love not having to stand over the stove! This is the way I&apos;ll be cooking it now.
5,"How fast and easy!  Using the slow cooker made for much less fuss, and the results were so good that my family requested that I make another batch the next day.  My slow cooker worked beautifully on the high setting as long as I remembered to stir this occasionally. I did once substitute 1/2 cup of cream for 1/2 cup of the milk for a wonderfully rich and flavorful pudding, but it was also delicious using only the milk. My family thought this lovely with fresh strawberries, chilled, but I enjoyed it while it was still warm.  If you&apos;ve never had homemade tapioca, forget you&apos;ve ever tried that store-bought packaged stuff.  This is the way to go!  Thanks for the great recipe!"
5,This was DEE-licious. I used the 1 1/2 qt. slow cooker that only heats to hight and cooked it for 2 hours. I used 1/2 cup sugar (perfect sweetness) 2 TBSP vanilla like it says in the video and 2 egg yolks. You don&apos;t really need to cook it long after adding the egg yolks since you&apos;re not bringing the temp down much so it cooks in just a minute. We were ooh-ing and ahh-ing so much over the flavor that my son even turned down ice cream for it and he didn&apos;t like tapioca before this!
5,this is the best Tapioca pudding i&apos;ve ever had i am not a big fan of any puddings but my husband loves it so i made this one and omg im now a huge pudding fan. this recipe is amazing i didn&apos;t change a thing
3,I made this exactly as written except for reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup. At first I was worried about the consistency because it looked thinner than I am used to when it was done. However it thickened up nicely when it cooled. Something about the flavor is a little off for me though and it also tastes a little salty. I may try making it again but use only 1/4 tsp. salt and maybe use two whole eggs instead of two egg yolks. As much as I like vanilla I think that I would only use 1 tsp vanilla next time too so I can really get the tapioca taste I&apos;m looking for.
5,This was lovely and made the whole house smell great! I subbed 1 tbsp powdered ginger for the fresh and it worked out great. I also subbed 2 c milk and 1 1/4 c sugar for the sweetened condensed milk. This tastes great and is a lot cheaper than these small boxes of chai at the store!
5,"This is a great base recipe for Chai that I will use again and again.  I intend to make a batch each weekend and store it in the fridge to save on calories (and money) for Chai from the coffee shop!  Comparatively, this recipe is pretty low calorie.  90 cal per serving compared to 240 cal for a grande Chai latte at Starbucks.  My first batch had a good balance of spices, but was just a little sweet for my family&apos;s liking.  I think next time I make it, I&apos;ll use 3/4 of the sweetened condensed milk rather than the whole can."
3,Am a little suprised that so many people said this was good. Not spicey enough and the sweetened condensed milk adds a totally different flavor. Does not taste like a traditional Chai tea.
5,This recipe is very good. I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp nutmeg a dash of fennel seeds and a dash of anise. Also a handy conversion is: one cinnamon stick equals 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. It makes the house smell great!
5,I used A LOT of spices and will keep this spiced water as a base to make tea. I&apos;m freezing some of it and putting the rest in the refrig. When I&apos;m ready for my chai I can prepare 1 cup at a time. I heat it up add the tea bag as usual. After steeping I add milk and perhaps sugar. Actually tastes much like the chai tea bags I purchase but this is much healthier! (I forgot the ginger and will add it next time!)
5,"My slow cooker is small so I only made half of this recipe. I added all of the ingredients (except for peppercorns...I didnt have any) and put it on low around 10pm so I could enjoy it around 7am the next morning. The chai tasted GREAT. I added the condensed milk little by little so I could avoid having it taste too sweet. This tastes just like the Starbucks version, but a little better."
5,We made this for Christmas day and it was a big hit. We did some variations. First we let the tea bags sit in the slow cooker for 4 hours or so with the spices. It made the tea nice and smooth (decaf). Instead of fresh ginger we used about a tablespoon of the dry stuff. We also used dried cardamom and about half the cloves. We did included nutmeg. Wow! we will be using this recipe often and avoid the long and expensive lines at that well known coffee shop.
4,I was leary of this recipe for some reason but it turned out really good! I used 1 1/2 tsp ground cardamom (it&apos;s all I could find) and 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sticks. I also used fat free sweet and condensed milk and it tastes great. When I strained the tea I made sure most of the ground cinnamon and cardamom were strained out otherwise it would have had too much muckiness to it. I would make this again.
5,Best chai ever! My crockpot could only hold 2 quarts so I couldn&apos;t make a full batch. I also chose to add allspice nutmeg and a vanilla bean.
5,"Perfect!  Followed the recipe to a T and it was great.  There were a TON of leftovers. I used a 5 pound roast.  I put some of the extra meat in the fridge for later and still had a lot of leftover meat.  I filled my muffin pan with scoops of meat.  Each individual muffin tin holds the same as a typical sandwich.  I put the muffin tin in the freezer and froze the individual serving size leftovers.  After about 2 hours I took the tin out removed the meat  muffins.  Next they went into a ziploc and they will not all stick together.  To reheat just pop one in the microwave on 50% power.  These are great for a quick sandwich, with rice, with beans, or with eggs."
5,"Absolutely delicious!!! I would give this one 10 stars! I cooked on low for 10 hours, then shredded and kept it on warm for a couple more hours. I am seriously keeping this recipe forever. This is the perfect weekend bbq/potluck food, and went great with grilled corn on the cob and red potato salad. Also, when you shred the meat you can remove most of the fat. I think you could do without the oil. I used kraft honey bbq sauce - just what I had on hand. SOOOO tasty. You can&apos;t stop eating this."
5,"I pulled 40 lbs. of pork using this recipe for my son&apos;s graduation party. I also froze it before reheating it in crockpots. I received many compliments.  It turned out much more moist than the root beer recipe I tried earlier. I did serve BBQ on the side, but I&apos;m not sure it needed it."
5,"I love this recipe! I&apos;ve made it several times and everyone always goes crazy for it. I use a 6-7 lb. bone-in shoulder. I&apos;ve used a deboned and a bone-in and the bone-in definitely comes out a little tastier. I leave out the oil and the chicken broth, because I think the broth makes it too juicy and I just don&apos;t think the oil is necessary. Instead, I just put in the entire bottle of barbeque sauce. I use like 10 cloves of garlic and a huge vidalia onion. You don&apos;t have to bother chopping up the onions or garlic too small because by the time it&apos;s done, they&apos;re all dissolved. I put in closer to 1/2 cup brown sugar, 8 or so drops of Liquid Smoke, two tablespoons of chili powder and a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. In my opinion, and I think everyone I&apos;ve fed this to would agree, the cinnamon is KEY. It makes it SO GOOD and adds such a depth of flavor. The recipe doesn&apos;t mention this, but make sure you put the roast in the slow cooker fat side up so it can drip down into the meat while it cooks. I cook it on low overnight for about 12 hours, then pull it and remove all the fat, strain the liquid and add it all back to the cooker for another 4 hours or so. The leftovers really do taste better every day. Make sure to make a semi-sweet southern slaw to go along with it - HEAVEN!  ;)"
5,"Made this with a 6 lb. pork loin roast I had bought on reduced for quick sale. I followed the ingredients increased for my size of roast, except for using dry mustard in lieu of prepared and adding liquid smoke. I cooked on high two hours and then low for seven. I took the meat out and it shredded with complete ease two hours before serving, then placed back in the crockpot. There was alot of liquid and needed to reduce a good two cups worth after placing the shredded meat back in the crockpot. Added a bit of BBQ sauce and liquid smoke at that point to give the meat a bit more flavor, even though it was tender, still lacked that BBQ flavor. After another two hours this was the best tasting pork I&apos;ve evern made in the slow cooker. Our guest even requested to take home some for lunch the next day. I&apos;m not sure I&apos;d add the broth next time, I feel the fat in the meat made plenty of juice.  *Note when placing meat in crockpot, always leave the fat side on top so the juices sink down into the meat while cooking...read that somewhere."
3,"I was so excited to try this, but ended up a little disappointed. Although it was very easy to get together and the pork turned out perfectly and just fell apart, the taste just wasn&apos;t doing it for me. It was way too sweet for me, I was hoping for more of that smoky flavor. If I make this again I won&apos;t be adding any sugar, maybe more vinegar and maybe some liquid smoke to give it that pulled pork flavor."
4,Good flavor. Estimated cooking time was about right. The only change I made was omitting the thyme as I don&apos;t like the flavor with pork. I&apos;ll definitely make it again.
5,This is amazingly good!!  The roast I had was 8 pounds and this recipe easily doubled in my large oval crock pot!!  We had lots of leftovers which we froze....and it was just as good after freezing!!
5,"This is an excellent recipe.  My family loved it and it quickly disappeard.  I used a 2 1/2 pound pork roast and it turned out perfect. I have tried to find a good recipe for pulled pork for years.  My search is over, this is it!"
5,"SUPERB beef stew!  I took the great base recipe, and tweaked it with a compilation of reviewer recommendations.  The end result is a winner, to be sure.  Here is what I did (and I won&apos;t change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt.  Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag.  Shake beef in bag to coat.  Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned.  Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften.  Transfer to slow cooker.  2.  Mix beef broth (I used Swanson&apos;s Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine.  Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker.  3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions:  increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick&apos;s Beef Stew Seasoning.  Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast!  I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread."
5,"I have been making this stew for almost 3 years and wanted to review it again.  Although I&apos;m sure Corinne&apos;s suggestions are good, what I like most about this recipe is the simplicity of preparation...no browning the beef.  I&apos;ve made this over a couple dozen times at least - doubled - and have never had leftovers.  It is a terrific recipe as written."
5,"I made this stew for the first time using Corinne&apos;s suggestion.  The stew turned out great!  The next week, I made the stew following the exact recipe (minus the celery, since I didn&apos;t have any); and I must say that the stew turned out EVEN BETTER when following the exact recipe.  (Also, I didn&apos;t have as many dishes to wash.)  This stew is SO DELICIOUS.  Next time I make this you can bet I will follow the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN."
5,"I don&apos;t understand why Corrine doesn&apos;t just post her own recipe for beef stew.  The point is to review the given recipe, not list a million changes to it.  This stew is perfect AS WRITTEN.  If you make any changes, you are not making this recipe for beef stew!!!!"
5,"THIS is a terrific basic recipe!!  Nothing to stop you from adding your favorite things - although the TASTE is GREAT just like it is.  I used chuck because it&apos;s not as dry as a bottom round.  I had a tomato so I chopped it up & added it.  I saw where someone had added an envelope of beef gravy - great idea too!!!  Thank goodness there&apos;s people out there REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK!!  Oh, and don&apos;t bother to brown the beef the way some recipes state - it only makes the beef dry.  Thanks for this recipe."
5,"An excellent and easy stew recipe. I make minimal changes (I like parsnips, so I add three chopped in place of celery, and I add a little more broth because I like more gravy), but that&apos;s about it. This is one of those easy, homey, stick-to-your-ribs recipes. Some of the reviews tick me off: Yes, it&apos;s a ""regular"" stew recipe because it is, after all, STEW. And all the changes that other reviewers make? Don&apos;t say ""I made this recipe, but I changed EVERYTHING about it."" You aren&apos;t doing this recipe justice.. heck, you aren&apos;t doing THIS recipe at all. I&apos;m as guilty of changing recipes to suit my tastes and pantry as much as anyone, but at least tell us that you&apos;ve made the original recipe as written before doing your million-and-one changes! Thanks for sharing this tasty-as-written recipe, Buchko!"
5,"I made similar adjustments to previous raters.  I dredged the beef in flour/salt/pepper and pan friend until browned in olive oil before adding to the slow cooker.  Then I added some butter and onion to the pan and cooked until softened. Next I deglazed the pan with some of the broth being sure to  scrape up the yummy bits. In total I used 2 10 oz cans of beef broth.  I added 10 oz. sliced button mushrooms. Used almost 2T worchestershire sauce, added a bunch of extra herbs and finally thickened with cornstarch.  It was perfect."
4,"I followed Corinnes suggestions and this came out fantastic! The flavor and cosistency were wonderful, and just as good the next day. 
                                So you dont have to search for it, here is her suggestion: 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick&apos;s Beef Stew Seasoning."
5,"I have this exact recipe in the recipe booklet that came with my slow cooker! I make it all of the time and my family loves it. I use a packet of dry onion soup mix in place of all the spices, only because it&apos;s an easy and convenient way to toss it together."
3,This just tasted like regular old beef stew to me.  Nothing unusual or great about it.  My fiance said there was too much meat and not enough vegetables.  I&apos;ll keep searching for another recipes.  I think this would&apos;ve benefited from a 1/2 c. red wine.
3,"Many other reviewers have noted that - as written - the lasagna needs to be watched carefully for appropriate cook time. That pretty much negates the benefit of a crockpot approach for me (I prefer to just start the food, then not worry about it.) What the recipe is really missing is WATER. Before assembling, mix your tomato sauce with equal parts water. Use that as your tomato mixture. With the extra water, the recipe won&apos;t turn out as dry. It will take longer to cook - about 6-8 hours on low. The benefit there is you can pretty much go to work, run errands, etc. while your food cooks. Now it makes sense as a crockpot recipe again."
5,"We really enjoyed this!! I did some playing around with it as others have. Replaced the cottage cheese with Ricotta and I used more tomato sauce and paste to make more of the sauce as I have one of the old crockpots that&apos;s just huge. I also put in some Italian seasoning and some roasted garlic. Just make sure that all your noodles are covered with the sauce and it will come out just great. The time was a little different for me too. It only took about 4 1/2 to 5 hours in my pot, but you have to remember that all crockpots are not the same, the size and shape can change the timing a great deal.  I&apos;ve made this twice now and it has come out wonderful both times. I serve it with Mama D&apos;s Italian bread (from this site) and a salad and what a meal!!  Thanks Kim for a great way to make homemade lasagna without all the fuss!"
5,"This turned out very well! Delicious and filling. Of course, I had to read the reviews before attempting this. First, yes, do away with the salt entirely. The pasta sauce will have enough of it. Second, to make the cheese mixture easier to spread (I substituted fat-free ricotta for cottage cheese), add a slightly beaten egg. Finally, make sure that you are using oven-ready/no-boil lasagna noodles (don&apos;t cook them beforehand) instead of the regular kind. They will absorb the liquids and therefore cook on their own. It really does depend on your pot, but my lasagna cooked in just under four hours. The sides were slightly burned (but I like it that way... and I&apos;m thankful I sprayed the pot with Pam before adding the ingredients). Next time I think I might add some drained canned mushrooms to the sauce to make sure that I get my serving of vegetables, since I will definitely make this again (no more Stouffer&apos;s for me)."
4,"If all items are preassembled and put in the &apos;fridge the night before, it needs to only be in the slow cooker for half the recommended time."
5,"This is such a hit!  I have made it several times before and people always ask for the recipe.  Today was the first time I brought it to work and everyone raved about it.  Normally, I follow the recipe, but this time I added a big jar of Ragu to the hamburger, onion, and garlic.  I add extra mozzarella on top in the last hour so it is cheesier on top.  I also cooked it for 1 hour on low and 2 1/2 hours on high and it was wonderful.  The noodles were just right.  I will continue to make this often.  Thank you."
5,"We did a lot of changes but loved it.  We used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage, used fresh basil in the sauce mixture, added jar sauce over the top of the filled crock pot and topped off with some of the saved mozzeralla cheese the last 30 minutes.  This is easy and a keeper."
5,"Delicious and perfect. I feel it&apos;s a good idea to read every review if possible, at least skim them, because everyone&apos;s crockpot and experience is different and you can avoid costly mistakes. I did that and was able to make the adjustments that made this dish turn out wonderful. This was the first dish I made in my new 6-quart slow cooker (call me lasagna lover). I used 3 cups jarred spaghetti sauce, 1 cup water, and half a can diced tomatoes in juice because I had it left over from another day. I added an egg to the ricotta and used minced dried onion instead of a fresh one, and garlic powder. Also added some Italian spices, not too much, and no salt. I used 12 oz. whole wheat lasagna, the regular kind, not precooked. I cooked the whole dish on low for EXACTLY 4 hours, and it turned out heavenly. I think a lot of the problem of dry, chewy noodles comes from overcooking...do not be tempted to keep on cooking. Cover the noodles in sauce and mozzarella, and you will be fine. I didn&apos;t use the high setting at all. Will repeat often."
4,I substituted 2-jars of spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes onions and garlic. Added minced garlic (from the jar) oregano italian seasoning and salt to taste. Also I added italian sausage to the hamburger. It came out delicious but a bit overcooked at 8-hours in the crock pot. Next time I will adjust to 6-hours.
1,I hated this lasagne. It was VERY salty and I saw no benefit to cooking it in the slow cooker. No time was saved. It&apos;s faster to cook lasagne in the oven and the taste was lacking. I&apos;ll stick with my tried and true lasagne recipe from Bon Appetit!
4,"I wouldn&apos;t consider this clean eating or low carb however it was good. The flavor was very mild so if you aren&apos;t going to add hot sauce you may need to add more spices. In my opinion if your chicken has been cooking long enough you don&apos;t have to remove it to shred it. It comes apart nicely by just stirring it. Ours was much more ""soupy"" than the photo. It was like a chicken chili. I added sour cream and cheese and served with tortilla chips."
5,"This is a winner! Amazing flavors and the aroma is absolutely sublime. I cooked on Low, expecting to be out all day but came back home mid day...yikes what a test of patience for not getting into the crock pot before cooking time was over. 
                                My husband has his simply with homemade Mexican rice. Mine was in a tortilla topped with cheese and dollops of sour cream with a side of Mexican rice. This is a keeper! Glad I came across your recipe Michelle...
                                P.S. A quick way to shred cooked chicken is to cut breasts in half and place them in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attached. Run on medium (6) speed for 15 to 20 seconds or until the chicken is well-shredded. No stand mixer,then use hand mixer and cut chicken into smaller pieces."
5,"Excellent and easy! I left out the broth  by  mistake but I guess that kept it from being too soupy as some other reviewers mentioned. Had to add a little salt at the end because of that, but nbd. Also left out the cayenne for Hubby&apos;s sake. He gets hiccups when he eats spicy foods! LOL! I was in a hurry and hadn&apos;t planned ahead enough to let it cook for 9 hours, so I cut up the chicken into big chunks, about 4"" each, and cooked it on High for 4 hours. The chicken was fully cooked but still in nice chunks, although it did shred easily if you went at it with a fork. I served it in soup mugs over Mexican rice and the family just loved it! Thanks for posting! (yeah, I know, the rice negated the low-carb thing, but it&apos;s optional! :D  )"
4,"Tweek the recipe to your liking. It&apos;s great base ingredients to start out with! My husband is Mexican so we used red enchilada sauce, and Chipotle salsa in the recipe. alot of cilantro and onions. Topped with tons of Mexican white crumbling queso.(farmers cheese) Thanks."
5,Fantastic dish with such ease to make!! Cooked as directed but I doubled the recepie and added chili powder also used the 32oz. Container of broth! I thought it would be a little more like a soup until I shredded the chicken! Wow! It was very hearty tasty and low carb! Will make again for sure!
5,this is a definite keeper. In place of the seasonings I used a Tbsp of taco seasoning which seemed to work nicely. I ate mine like a dip with tortilla chips and the kids used theirs as burrito filling. This is as &apos;clean&apos; as my eating gets in order to avoid forfeiting flavor... great recipe!
5,"Though I did use chili powder instead of cayenne to temper the heat I made absolutely no other changes. My whole family not only LOVED this but I was asked to officially put it into rotation (that&apos;s what we call my ""go to"" meals that are quick and easy for busy days). As another reviewer said it did turn out more soup like but decreasing the chicken broth (&/or adding more chicken) will change that easily and the soupiness has no bearing on the taste."
5,"Did not use slow cooker at all - made in 20 minutes.  I skipped the broth, used leftover rotisserrie chicken and sub&apos;d the cayenne pepper for some chili pepper and chipotle pepper.  No salt needed.  Served w/ warm tortiallas and a cabbage/green apple salad."
4,"Tasty, easy to add more of your favorite vegetables and make the recipe your own"
2,misleading not low carb.
5,"This recipe is AWESOME with a few modifications. I made it for my mom, husband, 3 year-old and 8 month old and it was a HUGE hit with all of us! My husband liked it better than his grandma&apos;s homemade chicken and dumplings and the gourmet chef who lives next door tasted it and thought it was an old family recipe. :) He loved it! First, you definitly need to add spices. I used cumin, parsley, poultry seasoning, seasoned salt and pepper. Next, I only used 1 can of biscuits, not 2. (I even used the reduced fat version and they tasted the same!) Thirdly, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. Instead of water, I used 3/4 can of low sodium/lowfat chicken broth. At first, it seemed like way to much liquid, but eventually the biscuits soaked it all up! Fourthly, I added 2 CANS of mixed veggies (mix of carrots, peas, tiny potatoes, celery). I am not a fan of canned veggies by any means, but they tasted great in this recipe- so tender! I did add red onion, but I used only half and chopped the pieces extra small. Lastly, I cooked the biscuits for almost 3 hours for a total cooking time of 6.5 hours on high. 30 minutes is just not enough time! Another tip- if you accidentally add too much chicken broth, add a bit of sifted flour and the sauce thickens right up! I know that this recipe will be a winter tradition in our household for years to come!"
5,"Excellent! Only adjustments needed are as follows:  Use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (as directed- don&apos;t deviate with other cream soups) cover with 1 14 oz can of chicken broth (no need to cover with water, dillutes flavor).  Put torn biscuit dough in roughly 90 minutes before ready to serve and make sure that you push them down into the liquid mixture a little, so that they get cooked on the tops, too and saturated with the chicken flavor.  I made this recipe with veggies and without, it was better WITHOUT, because the consistency was better and the veggie flavor soaked into the dumplings. 5 hours on High is MORE than enough total cooking time.  Also, leave chicken partially frozen when starting out and don&apos;t tear meat until right before adding dumplings, this keeps chicken moist.  THIS ONE&apos;S A WINNER!!!!"
5,"Sorry if this get long winded, but I love dumplings. I cant believe how good this recipe is! Ive been raised on my Great Grandma&apos;s recipe from West Virgina, and was sure this would be horrible. It was really good, and I just changed a few things to make it more like Na-Na&apos;s. I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup. I added some celery tops with leaves(removed after cooking). And just so theres no confusion, the biscuits will turn into dumpling (like noodles) NOT drop biscuits like you would expect. The only thing I would do differently would be to roll the dough out into small pancake sizes and cut that into strips. (The dumplings were just a little doughy-er than we are used to.)A little salt and pepper, and  with those changes, this would be as close to the all day version as you can get. My husband could&apos;nt tell the difference! Really good! Thank-you Janiece."
5,"Wonderful recipe.  And for all the morons who simply make a totally different recipe by their additions, subtractions, cooking a bit longer or shorter...try posting your own recipe and stop giving 4 stars to a perfectly good recipe.  All recipes are guidelines.  We all have different tastes, so either like the recipe or leave it.  tiny.mama"
5,I&apos;m giving this 5 stars for it&apos;s easiness and flavor. It tastes close enough to homemade to be really enjoyable. I used 2 cans cream of chicken 1 can chicken broth and 1 & 1/2 soupcans of water to cover 2 FROZEN (helps keep it tender) chicken breasts (just 2 of us). I added the water b/c I was worried about the salt and was glad I did. Cooked on low 8-9 hours adding 1 can biscuits 2 hrs before eating. It was very good! I&apos;m biased b/c I was raised on the best dumplings of all time (my mom&apos;s) so of course they&apos;re not quite homemade but hubby devoured this and I liked it too! The chicken was SO TENDER I was very surprised! I think cooking on low and not cutting up the chicken into chunks before cooking is key so the juices don&apos;t just leak out... they get stored in the breast which u can pull apart later. This is great if you&apos;re learning to cook in college or just in a pinch for a great meal! Simple yummy and comforting! Thanks for a great recipe & quick lifesaver! We barely had leftovers! Leftover chicken could easily be turned into a soup or even enchiladas the next day! UPDATE 8-27-07: Veggies add water so adjust accordingly or skip water altogether. Right before adding biscuits if liquid&apos;s too watery mix a few TBSPNs of flour with cold water & stir into crock pot to thicken. Also cut biscuits into quarters. Cranking up heat to high during biscuit cooking made them cook faster and better - 1 hr instead of 2. So far Pillsbury&apos;s Grands Homestyle Buttermilk biscu
5,This was great! I made changes as suggested by others. I used 8 small breasts used chicken broth instead of water added a bit of white wine (less than 1/4 cup). I seasoned the chicken before cooking with seasoned pepper garlic powder chicken seasoning and paprika. I added fresh celery along with the onion. I added green peas & water & flour for thickening before I added the biscuits. I flattened the biscuits and cut into strips and seasoned with salt & pepper on both sides. Cooked an additional 2 hours on high without opening the lid and it was perfect.
5,"It really irritates me that people give a recipe 5 starts and then proceed to change it so that it&apos;s not even the same recipe anymore.  If you don&apos;t like the recipe as is then don&apos;t give it a high rating - post your own separately somewhere else!  That&apos;s not only rude, but it&apos;s misleading."
5,WONDERFUL!! I used chicken broth instead of water and did not use the onion. Did season with salt pepper and a little onion powder. I put on low in morning before going to work and let cook all day. I shredded the chicken(had used frozen chicken breasts) and turned to high and added 2 cans of biscuits each biscuit into 4 pieces. Let cook 1-11/2 hrs on high. Was absolutely the BEST!!
4,I finally made this recipe today for our Sunday lunch. This was very tasty with my changes. First of all I have the oblong slow cooker so I used 6 small to medium sized breasts first I poured half of a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker then placed the chicken that was seasoned with salt pepper poultry seasoning and paprika then I placed the onions on top then a can of cream of chicken soup can of cream of celery soup then the remaining chicken broth. One hour and 45 minutes before serving I shredded the chicken. Then I put the store brand Texas style regular biscuits that I had quartered on top. One can of 10 count biscuits was plenty! This turned out very well and not too liquidy. This will be great to add veggies to and also for cold days. My 16 year old son ate this up like he hadn&apos;t been fed in years. Thanks for the post!
3,Super Easy! I liked it but my husband didn&apos;t...figures
5,"This is the first thing I cooked in my new crockpot.  Taking other reviewers&apos; advice, I browned a 3.66 lb. boneless chuck roast in a little olive oil after rubbing low sodium Montreal Steak Seasoning and 1 chopped fresh garlic clove.  I cut the roast in half before setting it in the crockpot as it was so big.  I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of water and used small red potatoes, along with 1 sliced onion and I also chopped up some baby carrots, 2 more cloves of garlic and omitted the celery.  Halfway through I ended up adding more potatoes and carrots as I didn&apos;t think I had enough veggies. I&apos;m glad I did as the veggies I first included basically turned to mush (but goooood mush).  I also added garlic pepper and garlic salt along the way to taste as it cooked.  This cooked on low from 915am to about 630pm, but really was ready about an hour before.  My husband took a little flour with 3/4 of the juice and some more garlic pepper and made an excellent gravy.  The juice was so hot from the crock pot that we didn&apos;t need to put it into a sauce pan. just whisked it up in a bowl.
                                
                                I have to say, this is the best pot roast.  The recipe is a good template that you can play around with to taste.  The only things I woud change is that I would use whole baby carrots and add in the veggies (all except the onions) about halfway through instead of straight at the beginning.  The other reviewers&apos; comments really helped me in fixing this recipe to my own taste.  It worked out wonderfully"
5,"Don&apos;t make the mistake I did at first.  The roast I was cooking was only 2 pounds so I thought, ""Half the weight means half the cooking time.""  After only 4 hours of cooking in the crock pot, the roast was edible--it had a nice flavor and we could definately get our teeth through it, but it wasn&apos;t even close to the glorious ""fall apart on your plate"" stage.  We didn&apos;t need all of the roast to feed the four of us for dinner, so I left the rest of it in the crock for an additional 4 or 5 hours and by the time I took it out, it was a fabulously tender and tasty roast.  I&apos;m glad I&apos;ll know for next time."
5,"I loosely followed this recipe, and chose it because I wanted an alternative to the standard cream of mushroom soup (I don&apos;t mind it too much, but I&apos;m not the biggest fan). I had just over two pounds of beef. To avoid having it turn out bland, I added 1 cup of beef broth instead of water, 1/4 c Worcestershire sauce, parsley, and two cloves of garlic minced. I didn&apos;t have onion soup mix, so I added around a tablespoon of onion powder, and some salt and pepper. I also cut up one large carrot, two stalks of celery, 5 small potatoes. Then, I let it all sit and marninade overnight in the slow cooker dish in the fridge. I followed the rest of the directions as written, turning on the slow cooker and letting it all cook 10 hours while I was driving to and from or at work. When I got home, it smelled wonderful (my husband had to smell it all day!) and the meat was falling off the bone. I sampled some of the veggies and almost couldn&apos;t stop eating them! I made Sky High Yorkshire Pudding with this (highly recommended). With my slight variations, I give this recipe a 5! Great base to start with and adjust to your taste."
5,"It would be very helpful and courteous to review a recipe made EXACTLY the way it is written. It is not beneficial at all to read how you rated your own recipes using another person&apos;s name. Marie, your recipe made as written, is excellent. Thank you!"
5,"THIS IS AWESOME.  Boyfriend and I couldn&apos;t believe it!  I modified the recipe based on other people&apos;s comments.  Everyone was saying to add Montreal Steak Seasoning, which I didn&apos;t have. So I looked it up and it&apos;s basically comprised of pepper, salt, and paprica. For the rub i combined 1 Tbsp each  of kosher salt, crushed peppercorns (i crushed), and paprika. I also added about 1 tsp. of garlic powder. This I rubbed on the meat and sprayed a little olive oil over top. To the pot, i added 3 large chopped carrots, six or so small red potatoes (chopped), an onion, and half a container of small fresh mushrooms. Additionally, I added 2 bay leaves, about a tsp. of worshire sauce, and the onion soup mix along with the water. Didn&apos;t have celery.  SUPER SPICE-A-RIFIC!!!  Enjoy!"
5,"I have cooked a lot of roast in my day and this is the ONLY time it has come out perfect!  I didn&apos;t add any vegetables with it except for cutting an onion in half and setting it on top of the roast for the last 3 hours of cooking time.  I made mashed potatoes and green beans separate, just don&apos;t like my potatoes to taste like anything except potatoes.  I also whisked 2 teaspoons of cornstarch with 1/2 cup water and added to the au jus that I transfered to a sausepan.  I boiled the au jus mixture for about 5 minutes, whisking often, for a wonderful brown gravy.  I was tempted to not cook it as long as the recipe calls for, but please just let it cook and keep check on the liquid level.  Roast cooked this way just melts in your mouth!  Thanks for sharing your talent!"
5,"Used CHUCK roast-important! Quartered red potatos and put in crockpot with baby carrots. Boiled 1 cup water with 2 beef bullion cubes in microwave. Sprinkled most of the dry onion soup over vegetables(just potatos and carrots-didn&apos;t use celery and onion), then added stirred beef bullion and stirred the veggies. Browned roast seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Added roast to crockpot,sprinkled remaining dry onion soup mix on roast and spred with a little water,  and cooked for 5 hours on HIGH. Removed roast and vegetables to rest and added gravy to skillet whisking in a half cup of water with 2 TBLS flour to thicken. This was abolutely the BEST! I like the strong flavor it gives the carrots, but you may wish to steam them separately."
5,why do people take a recipe and turn it into another totally differtn recipe using it as a review? Just create a new recipe.
5,"This was fabulous. I took a few reviewers advice and soaked the roast in red wine vinegar over night. I made a rub with pepper, salt, lemon pepper and freshly minced garlic and then browned the roast on all sides. I was using my mother-in-law&apos;s roaster and it didn&apos;t have low, med and high so I set it to about 200 degrees  for 8.5 hours. I added the onion soup mix, some onion, lots of garlic, carrots, some celery we needed to get rid of and 2 potatoes. We served it with Sky High Yorkshire Pudding (allrecipes.com) which was great! We also had garlic mashed potatoes and an easy green salad. This was an AT recipe and we&apos;ll use it again!"
3,"I followed the recipe exactly and was a bit disappointed. I had high hopes starting out but the end result was rather bland. Don’t get me wrong, the meat was nice and tender, the veggies yummy (a little mushy, but a good mushy), and there was plenty of gravy. However it needed flavor, also searing the meat with salt and pepper didn’t do anything for it. What I would do next time is sear the meat with Worcestershire, olive oil, and a little butter. Then after I put the meat into the crock-pot with veggies on top of the meat. I would deglaze the pan with a mix of either Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon and beef stock. Then I would pour the liquid with pan drippings into the crock-pot. I’m not sure if I would use the onion soup mix or not, I think that would depend on the users personal preference."
5,"LOVED IT! --yes--I read all 200+ reviews before I made it. The issue with the ammount of broth does depend on the kind of bread you use.  Use less for fresh bread and more for store bought hard packaged. I used the packaged and used all the broth.  I think taking the time to mix it thourghly to absorb the liquid is essential also. I also got the feeling it was on edge of being over cooked,  so I skipped the 45 min high setting and I put the crock pot on Low for 4 hours and it was perfect."
5,"I have not made this particular recipe yet but I have made dressing in a slow cooker. As people will be checking here for Thanksgiving ideas I thought I would give some advice.  Just moisten the dressing at first and add the reserved stock as you go to control the moisutre. Check on it after the first couple hours and peek at it hourly after that. Also, I have read that if you put a cloth kitchen towel over the top and then put the lid on, condensation will be absorbed by the towel.  I think the soggy texture people are experiencing is due to adding too much broth at the beginning and the condensation accumulating on the lid and dripping back down. Add less broth at first and try the towel trick.  And at the end...Too dry? Add more broth.  Too soggy? Cook last 40 minutes uncovered. Happy Thanksgiving to All!!"
5,"I think the 4 1/2 c. broth is a misprint. I followed the advice of those who have gone before (and the back of the bread cubes package) and used 2 1/2 cups broth. It was still a little moist for my liking, so I recommend starting with 2 cups broth and adding more as needed. I also cooked and added 1 lb. sage-flavored Jimmy Dean sausage and reduced the amount of sage in the recipe to 1/2 tsp. I got rave reviews from the whole family on Christmas, including my extremely fussy stepdaughter, who had seconds! It also freed up precious oven space. This recipe will feed a LOT of people. Don&apos;t try to make this in a small 3 1/2 qt crock pot."
5,"I was nervous to try this and take the chance my stuffing wouldn&apos;t turn out on Thanksgiving but just had to give it a try.  I&apos;m so glad I did.  It was perfect and so easy.  I used about 10 cups of dried, cubed bread from Whole Foods and I also bought a fresh loaf of french bread and added about 3 cups of that.  The french bread has a good consistency and you don&apos;t have to worry about drying it out ahead.  I omitted the mushrooms but followed the recipe otherwise as written but added about 2 tsp. minced garlic to the onion celery mixture and added the spices into this mixture while it was cooking before pouring over bread.  DON&apos;T ADD ALL 4-1/2 CUPS CHICKEN BROTH.  Just add enough to moisten the bread because you&apos;ll be checking on it all day and can add more as needed.   I cooked it on high for 30 minutes then switched to low for another 5 hours till we were ready to eat.  I stirred about once an hour and added more chicken broth as needed.  By the end I had only added about 2-1/2 or 3 cups total.  I will definitely use this method again.  It&apos;s so nice to have one less thing to worry about at the end.  When you are mashing potatoes, baking rolls and making gravy the stuffing is sitting in the crock pot ready to go!"
5,"Could this BE any easier?  YES!
                                Prepare it the day before the feast AND line your pot with a cooking bag!
                                  
                                To do this, add all ingredients (in a bowl - not the pot) as directed EXCEPT for the eggs!  Cover and chill the mixture until completely cold in the fridge and THEN add the eggs and mix.  Spoon the mixture into the lined crock pot.  Cover and refrigerate until morning.  The next morning put the crock pot on Low heat and let cook all day.
                                
                                The only problem was that personally we found the stuffing too wet.  Next time I will reduce the amount of broth to 3 cups.  Before serving, I will add more if I feel it&apos;s too dry."
4,"Perfect recipe for a slow cooker or those who are counter constrained.  Used 3.5 cups of broth and it was perfect...  HELPFUL HINT:  Laying a dish towel over the top of the crock and then putting the lid on, helps keep extra moisture out of the stuffing.  Thanks Gayle for a nice addtion to my recipe box!"
5,"This recipe is so popular and famous in my family that I have to make at least 2 crock pots of it.  One for Thanksgiving and one for left overs.  
                                
                                This is a pretty moist stuffing as is.  If you like drier (fluffy) stuffing, use only about 1/2 of the chicken broth.  Also, I&apos;ve made this with both fresh and dried herbs...and fresh is the WAY TO GO with this.  It tastes so awesome.  If you use fresh herbs double the amount given for the dried as fresh herbs are not as pungent as dried.  It is also imperative that  very stale dried bread is used.  It helps soak up all that broth.  If you use fresh bread it will be very, very soggy, even if you cut the amount of broth in half.  This recipe does not need to be cooked for 8 hours.  Make sure mix up the stuffing every so often so the edges don&apos;t form a crust...although some people in my family like it kinda crusty.
                                
                                Also, the size of the bread cubes matters.  My family likes it best when the cubes are about half an inch by half an inch.  I personally like them bigger.  Don;t make them larger than 1 inch by inch though, otherwise it is much harder to mix up the spices and butter and you will end up with pieces of bread that have no real taste to them."
5,"AWESOME!!!  If you use your common sense this will NOT turn out soggy.  The recipe says 4 1/2 cups of broth OR AS NEEDED DEPENDING ON HOW DRY YOUR BREAD IS.  I did in fact use 1/2 of the broth called for & kept it on low for 4 hours... PERFECT!  Just like it was from the bird, the picky family loved it!  Thanks for making my life simple Gayle!!"
1,"This recipe RUINED my first Thanksgiving dinner for the inlaws last week. 4 1/2 cups of broth!!?? I added just 2.5 cups before realizing it was already WAY too much. It calls for 4.5 cups then says ""add enough to moisten."" I ended up with stuffing soup - totally inedible. It smelled delicious but....there has to be some sort of mistake."
5,"SO EASY AND SO GOOD!  I made a few modifications:  Using a 7.25lb Bone-in Turkey Breast I layered the bottom of my crockpot with 3 cut-up celery stalks, one sweet yellow onion, 1/4 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 tbsp. minced garilc.  I placed the turkey breast on top of the celery and onion, rubbed the turkey inside and out with the onion soup packet (lifting up the skin on top of the breast and adding the seasoning right on the meat works great!), also rubbed some oregano, sage, thyme, and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic on the breast.  Drizzled the breast with 1 tbsp. melted butter.  Cooked on high 1 hour, low for 7 hours more.  Perfect moist turkey!  Smells and tastes great, plenty of leftovers for sandwiches, casseroles, or enchiladas!  Will be a simple cold-weather staple for me."
5,"Excellent!! I made this tonight on a whim.  I was going to grill our 6.5 lb turkey breast, but thought I&apos;d give this a try.
                                
                                The only thing I really did differently was smear a couple of pats of butter on the inside of my slow cooker ( as some suggested) and I used dry herb and garlic soup mix that I had on hand.
                                
                                There is little preparation, I started the procedure at 7 am and didn&apos;t turn the cooker off until 4 pm   and left it on warm for 1-1/2 hours while I got busy with other things.
                                
                                This turkey breast browned nicely near the edges and lightly on top, it fell apart as I took it out and there was plenty of delicious juice in the pot.  
                                
                                The meat was succulent, with a melt in your mouth quality.  I didn&apos;t have time to make gravy out of the juice, so I just set it out as it was; it was wonderful on the turkey and potatoes I served. No additional seasoning needed at all.
                                
                                As a working mom, this was a godsend, and my husband and teenage children were very very pleased with the results (all, including me, were VERY skeptical at first)turkey breast in a slow cooker...ewww.
                                
                                I&apos;m going to share this recipe with my friends, it seems wrong not to."
4,"I like to put just enough water to cover the bottom of the crockpot. Place the turkey in, surround it with quartered onions and carrots, brush the bird with melted butter and then season it well. This makes a delicious turkey breast and I use the leftover turkey breast for casseroles, etc. in the future as it freezes well. The broth can be strained and used as well. Thank you."
5,"This was so easy and came out absolutely delish! I think I&apos;ll make this regularly to have turkey for sandwiches during the week -- way better than cold cuts and you don&apos;t have to do the whole Thanksgiving turkey thing to get it!  This would also be a great way to make extra white meat for a holiday when you&apos;re worried that your turkey won&apos;t be enough.  I put about a half a cup of white wine in the bottom of the crock pot, added some thickly sliced carrots, a sliced onion, about 4 stalks of choppped celery and a couple garlic cloves.  Added salt and pepper, placed the turkey breast on top, with the onion soup spread on it and under the skin and cooked it on low for 8 hours.  When it was done, I sauteed some mushrooms (4 containers:  two each Baby Bellas and shitakes, sliced), onion and garlic in a little olive oil and butter in a skillet, then added 1/2 cup white wine and about 2 cups of the broth from the crock pot.  I brought that to a boil and mixed another half cup of broth with a couple tablespoons corn starch to make a ""slurry"".  I added that to the skillet and it was so delicious over the turkey! Thanks for a great recipe!!"
5,"This is wonderful!  I did not know you could cook turkey breast in a slow cooker like this.  If you&apos;re like me, you&apos;ll probably be tempted to add stock or liquid to the meat -- DON&apos;T!  Believe me there&apos;ll be plenty of wonderful juices to make gravy from.  If you just don&apos;t feel comfortable cooking it dry you can add about 1 Tbsp of melted butter (which is what I did) and you&apos;ll be totally happy with the result.  Instead of using bone-in breast I used a piece of cut-off breast meat and it&apos;s still plenty yummy!  Great for making sandwich or salad turkey meat.  Try this recipe if you don&apos;t feel like turning on the oven and heating up the kitchen and potentially trying your bird."
5,This was my first turkey I&apos;ve ever made and it turned out great. I am cooking for two so I used a 3 lb boneless turkey breast. I forgot to buy the dry onion soup mix so I spinkled onion powder and Italian seasoning on the turkey breast. I cooked for 1 hour on high and then left it on low for another 3 hours and it turned out perfectly! I will definitely be making it this way again.
5,Moist and very tasty. I will be cooking many more turkey breasts in my slow cooker. It is August and it is too hot to cook. This is another good recipe that doesn&apos;t heat up the kitchen. I cooked a 7 lb. breast and used onion powder marjoram garlic pepper dried parsley and salt. As someone suggested I put a few pats of butter in the cooker. My slow cooker only heats from the bottom so I didn&apos;t want the meat to stick before the drippings were released. I cooked mine 3 hours on high. I will be using this for turkey enchiladas sandwiches and just as is. No more turkey cold cuts for me. This is too easy and tastes a zillion times better.
5,I am totally amazed at the &apos;brilliance&apos; of those who &apos;review&apos; a recipe after adding (in one case 9) so many ingredients that it doesn&apos;t even resemble the simple and delicious recipe that was shared!  Get real folks....send in your own recipe and leave the others alone!!!!!!!
5,"This recipe was a lifesaver for me! I&apos;m living on an island outside the US and had to drive 40 miles just to buy a frozen turkey breast, expecting to roast it in the oven for guests Thanksgiving evening. On Thanksgiving morning, I discovered we had no gas for the oven. So I found this recipe, had the onion mix on hand, and put it all in the slow cooker. Seven hours later, I had a perfectly cooked turkey breast. Perfect for nervous first-time Thanksgiving hostesses!!"
1,"Help!! I was so excited to try this. Is the problem with slow cookers that do or do not have a heating element on the sides? How could I go wrong w/just a turkey breast and dry onion? I&apos;m still a novice . After 7 hrs. on low, my turkey was as dry as could be and all the juice filled my 7 qt more than halfway. I would have prefered the juice inside the turkey. Any comments aprpeciated..I really needed this recipe. THanks"
5,Great and simple. A word of warning: Do NOT use a smokey BBQ sauce with lil smokeys.  Use a sweet bbq sauce.
5,"I have been making these for years.  The only thing I do differently is mix equal parts grape jelly, BBQ sauce and ketchup.  This also works just as well with cut up beef hot dogs.  Adults and kids alike love these.  I love them especially because they&apos;re fast, easy and can be prepared in advance."
5,I have been making these for parties for years!  People can&apos;t seem to get enough of these.  I always use apricot jelly but I&apos;m sure grape works just fine too.  These little things seem to be addictive no matter how you make them.
5,"I have been making this for 15 years. My x-wife had this recipe. Funny to see it again here. Nobody believs me when I say I used grape jelly in it. I take it to pot lucks all the time and it is one of the first dishes to go. Just took it to a b day party last month and when my girlfriend saw me putting grape jelly in with the links a sause, she grosed out and said no way she would eat it, and that I ruined the links she spent all that money on. After hearing all the great revievs from party goers she decided to give it a shot. She loved it!"
5,u can also make this with a jar of chili sauce and a can of thanksgiving cranberry jelly.  both are also good with little cocktail sized meatballs.  i too agree how addictive this recipe is!
5,A household hit for any occaision! I use equal parts of grape jelly and BBQ sauce. I also make this with prepared meatballs from the grociery store. This is also good using both meatballs and lil smokies. Just make sure the sauce covers the meat. This gives a little more variety when making for a party.
4,This is in the crockpot as we speak. It&apos;s not a holiday without these wonderful little gems. I did saute a little onion and garlic in butter then added the grape jelly and my own homemade barbeque sauce and peppered it up a bit before pouring over the Lil&apos; Smokies. OMNOM.
5,I was very skeptical about this recipe so I tested it first. Funny how the taste changes as it cooks. After an hour the smoky flavor from the bbq sauce was so overwhelming I thought this was a big mistake but after 2 hours the smokiness was slight and balanced and delicious. I couldn t believe it. I reheated them the next day in the microwave oven and they were still perfect. Strange but this works!
5,I love these little yummy appetizers and have eaten many sauce variations but my favorite is a combination of grape jelly catsup pineapple a little sugar and......diced jalapenos!
1,"These did NOT taste good. I used Famous Dave&apos;s Sweet N Sassy with grape jelly over miniature buffalo sausages. I wasted a bunch of sausages and had to come up with a ""plan B"" for my party. Will use a recipe with ingredients that aren&apos;t so bizarre. The grape jelly was just too much."
5,I used a 9-lb spiral cut honey cured ham with the stated brown sugar amounts and cooked on low for 4 hours.  I sealed over the ham with foil and then put on the lid.  The ham was delicious and very moist.  This is a great option for large family gatherings when your oven is being used for other dishes.  I&apos;ll definitely use this one again.
5,"I am sure this is a great recipe from all the reviews. The problem I had was I have a small crock pot, so I purchased a 3 lb picnic ham which to my delight fit perfectly in my crock pot. I had no idea how to adjust the time difference so I figured 3-4 hours on low. Apparently it was done in about an hour or two.  At 3 1/2 hrs it was brown and tough and in the garbage. So I just wanted to write this to help someone in the same predictament."
3,"Just be sure to buy a picnic ham (picnic shoulder or pork shoulder?)and not a smoked ham like I did!  By mistake I used a bone-in smoked ham & this was weird. It turned dark brown and fell apart.  Otherwise, am sure it&apos;s a good recipe like the others say.  Wish recipe had stated to NOT use a traditional smoked ham for us who don&apos;t normally buy non-traditional pork cuts."
5,"I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Sooo easy, and it turned out excellent. My husband wanted ham for Thanksgiving, and I knew the oven would be in use, so I wanted a slow cooker recipe. This one was perfect. I used a 2½ pound boneless ham, so I cut the brown sugar down to around 3/4 of a cup (½ cup in the bottom of the slow cooker and 1/4 cup rubbed on the ham). I flipped it around periodically while cooking so all sides would be evenly coated, plus I basted it once in a while with the brown sugar syrup. Even my picky 2-year old daughter (who does NOT like meat) enjoyed it... She finished a whole serving! Thanks for an excellent recipe!"
5,"Mmmmm - really delicious, and my mother-in-law kept tellimg me how good it was!  I used a shank-end spiral-sliced ham and was able to squeeze it into my 7 qt slow cooker by laying it sideways and kind of squishing it in (the spiral slicing made it kind of flexible).  One word of caution to anyone wishing to use a spiral-sliced ham.... 8 hours is really too long, try 4 or 5 hours.  I can&apos;t wait to try this recipe with a non spiral-sliced ham."
5,"Thanks for the recipe! Just a turkey wasn&apos;t going to be enough meat for Thanksgiving this year, so being able to cook a ham on the counter and not worry about oven space was a blessing!
                                I studded the ham with whole cloves and layed pineapple rings on top of it as my mom does and added the juice to the brown sugar mixture on the bottom. My guests were in love with the way my house smelled, and by the end of the night there was turkey left over, but not a bit of ham!!"
5,"This was the best ham I ever had! I grew up on a hog farm, so I&apos;ve eaten my fair share of it too.
                                It was so juicy and tender, I had to serve it with a spoon because it just fell apart!  My husband absolutely loved it and said that I better hold on to this recipe.  I think I can remember it, its so simple.
                                
                                I am a slow cooker novice, and the fact that this recipe had no liquid scared me a little, so I did add a little water to the brown sugar at the bottom to make it soupy, and only used a cup and a half of brown sugar.
                                I don&apos;t think I would have needed to though, there was alot of liquid from the ham.  
                                Definate keeper! Mmmmmm!!"
4,I only had a small 2.5 lb. ham without a bone and it still turned out great in my small crock pot with 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar.  It wasn&apos;t dry at all.
4,"I&apos;m Australian, so I has to use a 2.5 kilosemi-boneless shoulder ham from Woolies. I was worried that one ham and no liquid would result in burnt sugar all over the crock pot, so I added one little juice box of tropical juice and only used 1 cup of brown sugar. This worked beautifully, and the ham was fully cooked (i.e. the ham bone pulled out)after 7 hours.
                                
                                My ham didn&apos;t quite fit in the crock pot, to I tightly covered the top of the crockpot with aluminum foil and rested the lid on top, and it cooked just fine.
                                
                                A great way to cook ham! I will definitely use this one again, especially at holidays when you need the oven for something else."
5,"Living with two avid hunters I always have plenty of venison in the freezer.  I personally, do not care much for it, unless however it is cooked in a manner that I do not know what it is! I am not alone in this feeling. My children take my side.  Venison tends to taste ""wild"" if you do not have a great recipe.  This is a GREAT recipe! We did not tell the kids what it was until after they all had thirds!! They were shocked as was I.  This was a very tasty and easy.  We will make this many time in the future.  Thanks so much! Now maybe I can clean out the freezer!"
4,"Delicious! I used a TBLS of minced garlic instead of garlic salt, added 1 1/2c of water, and cubed a couple potatoes, 2 carrots, and 2 celery stalks. For those that said this was too salty - use real garlic instead of the salt (or garlic powder) add a little water, and perhaps using low sodium soy sauce/cream of mushrooms soup would help a bunch as well.  Turned out great for us and w/ my changes, we didn&apos;t find it salty! Good luck & happy cooking!"
4,Because of the previous reviews that I read on this recipe.  I added 3 potatoes and 1/2 cup of red wine to lower the salt.  It tasted just like beef bourgignon!! If you don&apos;t like wine I would suggest to add the potatoes as they will absorb the salt.  Hope that helps.
5,"Made this modified version for the first time and it was fantastic! Will be my standard Venison Roast recipe now. This is the entire recipe with modifications added:
                                
                                2-3 pounds boneless venison roast
                                1 large onion, sliced
                                1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
                                1 tbsp. garlic powder
                                1 tsp. ground black pepper
                                1 tsp. Mrs. Dash seasoning
                                1 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix with 2 cups of water (mix calls for 4)
                                1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of muchroom soup
                                4 carrots, sliced
                                3 medium potatoes, cubed
                                
                                1. Put cleaned meat in slow cooker and cover with onion, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and pepper.
                                2. Slice carrots and cube potatoes. Add to cooker.
                                3. In a small bowl combine the soup mix and the soup; mix together and pour mixture over venison. Cook on Low setting for 6 hours. 
                                4. Remove potatoes and mash with fork on plate. Add carrots to plate. Cut 1/2"" thick pieces of venison and add to plate. Add gravy to venison and potatoes to serve."
5,This was an excellent dish! I used a vension round roast. I combined a can of beef broth and about a cup of red wine. There was alot of liquid so I will cut down on the broth and wine next time. It did make wonderful gravy..I used 4 cloves of minced garlic no extra salt potatoes carrots and onion and alot of cracked black pepper. The roast was very tender and the dish was amazingly delicious! My husband and I agreed it was the best venison we have ever had!
5,This was amazing. Of course like others I made a couple small changes. I used 2 venison steaks and 2 tenderloins I had lying around. But I think this would work on any cut of meat. (Next weekend I am trying it with goose!) I boiled 1 cup of elbow macaroni in water w/ some beef bullion. I then added it to the crock-pot about 20 minutes before serving. In the future I will not use the garlic SALT and maybe throw in a cup of sour cream at the end. My trick to get the GAME out of Gamey meats. I soak the meat overnight in a FoodSaver vacuum sealed container with Milk! Work every time!
2,"I followed this recipe,that was a mistake.Is it salty,wow!!.I should&apos;ve read the reviews before making this.I agree with adding water with the soup ,I would also cut the onion soup mix in half at best.It could be a very good recipe,just make some changes to suit your taste.That is unless your able to take the top off a salt shaker and down the thing."
5,Awesome - and it smelled so good when I walked in the door! I agree I could barely tell it was venison. Even my son - who does not want anything to do with mushrooms loved it! I made french fries to go with the gravy and he poured the gravy all over his fries and venison! I will definitely make this again. One change I would make - I would use reduced sodium soup and garlic powder instead of salt. The onion soup mix has enough salt in it and I don&apos;t feel you need to add more. I did use liquid aminos since I was out of soy sauce but there isn&apos;t much difference in taste there anyway.
4,"I made this with an elk roast, and it was wonderful! I browned the roast in oil and butter in the pan first, deglazed the pan with some red wine, and added that nice sauce to the crock pot as well. I also added some rosemary. I love how the soup makes its own gravy! This was super good!"
5,These were fabulous! Everyone from Thanksgiving wanted the recipe. Followed exactly but next time I think I will cut the butter in half. Heres a hint to keep the potatoes from getting soggy in the crock. Lay a clean terry kitchen towel across the top of the crock then put the lid on. The towel absorbs the steam instead of it running back into the potatoes.
5,"Using sour cream and/or cream cheese in these mashed potatoes was nothing new to me. I&apos;ve always used one or the other or both but I also always use either russet or Yukon Gold potatoes rather than red skinned. What intrigued me was the idea (duh) of making them ahead of time and then reheating them in the slow cooker. I used the terry towel suggestion, as well as the suggestion to stir them every now and then to prevent them from browning along the edges. As others did, I simply forgot to put the butter in at the last, but with the gravy, the butter wasn&apos;t even missed. This method of preparation really eased the busy-ness and hustle-bustle in the kitchen on Thanksgiving day. I&apos;m hooked...I will always make the mashed potatoes this way on Thanksgiving from now on! Thanks for a simple solution to getting rid of at least one step of the Thanksgiving meal preparation. Thanks too, to those of you with the helpful suggestions!"
5,"This recipe makes AWESOME garlic mashed potatoes when you use the Garlic and Herb Cream Cheese plus add garlic salt, oregano, and 1 cup of an Italian Cheese Blend - we were in heaven!! Thanks so much for a great idea... I will never make any other mashed potatoes again (whether I make Garlic or plain!!) I made mine three days early and refrigerated the stoneware crock until I was ready to cook them."
5,"Oh my gosh...these potatoes were awesome!  And so incredibly easy.  Really a great ""make ahead"" recipe.  I made this in the morning and then put it in the slow cooker later in the afternoon so it was ready for dinner.  I used red potatoes with the skin on and they were great!  I too skipped the butter at the end (wasn&apos;t necessary).  FYI..I used a 3 lb bag of small red potatoes and this would be PLENTY for 6 adults for dinner.  3 hours on low in the slow cooker was perfect!  This one is a keeper!!!!!"
5,"Made potatoes the night before, warmed them up a little in microwave, then put them in crockpot for a few hours. Worked out very nice and everyone
                                said how nice it was to have hot mashed potatoes 
                                through the whole meal. Served it with BBQ ribs. Very good,will try it next Thanksgiving for sure!"
5,"Very easy to prepare, and even easier to eat.  The flavors in this dish combined very well, and tasted like no other mashed potato dish I&apos;ve ever had.  And it STAYED HOT throughout the whole meal, which is a rarity for any kind of mashed potato dish that I&apos;ve ever fixed.  One slight problem was that the potatoes didn&apos;t mash thoroughly, which left smallish chunks of whole potato in, but even that wasn&apos;t enough to detract from the overall experience.  (If you&apos;re particular about it, I would suggest running a mixer through it before placing in your Crock.)  I was pinched for time, and set the Crock on HIGH for 1 hour - they still tasted just fine, so I&apos;m not sure 3 hours on LOW is necessary.  (Tip:  halve the time if you&apos;re cooking on HIGH - 3 hours on LOW equals 1 1/2 hours on HIGH, just a helpful thing to know when cooking with Crock-Pots.)  Excellent dish.  Thanks, Bwaye, this will be going into my regular rotation!"
5,Very nice recipe! I make this recipe with light sour cream and light cream cheese. My husband tasted the potatoes before I added any butter and he said they were great as they were and since we were going to be serving them with gravy adding butter would make it too rich. I&apos;ll be making this again next week for Thanksgiving; I know it&apos;ll be a hit and best of all I won&apos;t have to be rushing around getting the potatoes ready while company is over. Thanks! UPDATE (11/09):I have made this for each Thanksgiving since I first tried them and they have always gotten many complements. For those that have wondered how much this makes volume-wise one and a half recipes (so 12 servings worth) fills up my 6 qt slow cooker. We serve it for 16 people at Thanksgiving and generally have some left over since there are so many other dishes on the table. I have used both red and russet potatoes and always leave the skin on and it is very good both ways. Thanks again for a great no-fail recipe!
5,YUM! Tasty but not overwhelming. It was so nice to be able to make these in the afternoon and load them into the crockpot to wait for my company to arrive later that evening. The only thing I&apos;ll change next time is to stir them periodically since they seemed to brown around the edges by the time they were served.
4,Very good potatoes but rather heavy vs light and fluffy. 4 stars for ease originality and time management. Especially loved the idea of the terry cloth submitted by a reader. Makes perfect sense!
2,"These were not a hit at our house.  Hubby said it was too rich, my 7 year old (who loves mashed potatoes) wouldn&apos;t eat them and I didn&apos;t really like the cream cheese taste.  I think I&apos;ll stick to my regular recipe but use the slow cooker idea.  Thanks anyways."
5,"I have to give credit where credit is due.  I have tried many recipes from this sight and I will have to say that this one is probally my favorite so far.  My whole family loves this.  It is my husbands favorite dish and my youngest son which is 9 says that this corn ""rocks"".  I do suggest using 1 and 1/2 (16 oz.) pkgs. of corn, 1/4 tsp. of pepper, and 1 tsp. of salt.  I also think that it is best to heat all the ingredients except for the corn on the stovetop before placing in the crockpot.  Start on high in the crockpot and cook for one hour.  Turn to low and cook for around 3-4 hours.  This one is realy good."
5,"if you are from texas and know rudy&apos;s bbq...this corn out does rudy&apos;s famous cream corn.  i was happy when the finished product was done.  this saves lots of money and is super easy to make for a bbq, dinner side, or potluck.  thank you for sharing =)"
5,This was great.  Everyone loved it at my Thanksgiving dinner.  I did use two packages of frozen corn.  I also took the advice of other users and melted the cream cheese and butter together then added to the crock pot.  This was very easy and good.
3,"Made this yesterday and it was very easy but I see why people have said in their reviews it is like corn with cream sauce instead of creamed corn.  It is the texture of the corn.  My advice (I wish I would have done this) use 2 bags frozen white corn (of course fresh is better but if you don&apos;t have fresh corn).  Put one bag in the blender or food processer with the 1/2 cup milk.  Combine bag of whole corn and blender corn in crock pot.  I think the cream cheese and butter could be reduced also.  Just ok, the recipe, I am sticking to my mom&apos;s tried and true, melt a stick of butter in pan add flour, add 2 bags white corn 1 blended in blender one whole, add milk and cook on stove top, she added pepper too, (mom :) rip)."
5,We loved this yummy sidedish!  I didn&apos;t have frozen corn so I added 3 drained cans of regular corn instead and it came out perfect.  I changed nothing else.  Certainly a once in awhile thing with all the butter and cream cheese but I might try it out next time with a butter substitute and lower calorie cream cheese and see how that works out.  Thanks for a FANTASTIC recipe!
5,"Yummy! I’ve never made homemade cream corn before. I cut the corn off  4 leftover ears and added a can of fiesta corn and a can of plain corn kernels that I had. As others said it seemed to need more corn for the amount of cream sauce that it makes. Do stir after your chunks of cream cheese and butter are at the melting point in your crock pot. They do not disperse evenly on their own. Flavor was more savory and corny than sweet if you do not add more sugar than the recipe calls for, but I really liked that. The cream cheese did not give it a big cheesey taste either. I love cheese but I wasn’t trying to make cheese corn. Much different and more gourmet tasting than the stuff in the can. I will make this again."
5,This recipe was so easy. I just dumped everything together and stired it every hour. The entire family loved this and my mother in law wanted a copy of the recipe.
5,I made this yesterday and we loved it so much I&apos;m making another pot today! I did double the corn and it was just perfect. Thank you for a new favorite slow cooker recipe!
5,This recipe was INCREDIBLE! This is the closest recipe I can find to Rudy&apos;s Cream Corn in Texas. I made it as a side dish to a BBQ brisket dinner with my family. The recipe was extremely easy to make. I followed some previous reviews and melted the cream cheese/butter before added to the crock-pot with the rest of the ingredients. I did measure out 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp. pepper. I increased the corn to 1 1/2 16-oz. bags of frozen corn kernels. I cooked it on high for about 2 hours or so and it turned out perfectly. I used reduced fat Philadelphia cream cheese light butter and a sugar/Splenda blend; no one could tell a difference! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my list of favorites.
4,These meatballs are very tasty however I&apos;m pretty sure there&apos;s an error on this recipe bc there is no way one serving is 1.25 POUNDS. I think they most likely meant for the recipe to call for 5 pounds total not 3x five pound bags which would mean 15lbs of meatballs in total. (Mama Mia!) I did mine with about 3.5 pounds of meatballs and still had a couple extra cups of sauce. I&apos;m sure you would be able to do this with up to 5lbs but not much more than that without adding more jelly/chili sauce.
5,The chili sauce is by the ketchup at the grocery store.
5,"I don&apos;t often leave feedback (lazy, I know) but I just had to give my review on this recipe.  I made this for a family potluck dinner, and I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used three 20 oz. bags of Trader Joe&apos;s frozen cocktail meatballs for a 6 qt. slow cooker.  I think the written recipe shows the wrong amount.  Anyway, even though the ingredients gave me some trepidation, this meal was the hit of the party, and the first to go!  This recipe is so easy, it&apos;s insane, and incredibly delish!"
4,"My mom has been making these for years, as they are great for large groups at picnics/pool parties. One suggestion with the prepared frozen meatballs is to cook them in an oven on a broiling pan, to get rid of the fat that would otherwise be in with the sauce (it&apos;s surprising how much there is!!!). I assemble everything the night before, throw the crock in the fridge, and turn it on the next day to heat through - also great to serve with hot dog buns - the sandwiches are delish!"
5,"Great recipe.  It was a hit my husband he loved it.  I used a 18oz jar of Grape jelly, one 12oz jar of chili sauce and one bag of meatballs more then enough for us two.  I thought it needed more flavor so I  added a can of chili. The chili gave it a little more taste and it worked out great. I added the chili at the last half hour of cooking."
5,Awesome recipe for entertaining. So simple & very crowd pleasing!
5,"These were AMAZING.  Super easy, delicious and versatile.  When making the sauce be sure to whisk it until there are no lumps of jelly to prevent pockets of overly-sweet flavor.  I made way too much, but these reheat so well that the large batch was totally gone in three days!  I do think the portion is incorrect as was noted in another review, and I used pre-made meatballs from my local grocery store.  I have made meatballs before, but these are the first to stay very moist, even when reheated!  This is a keeper!!"
5,"I have made this recipe for years for parties, Christmas Eve, family functions.  Everyone loves it & never have leftovers. I use frozen meatballs. I get them at Wal-Mart. It&apos;s a white and green pkg and I get Italian. If you find a good brand, they taste as good as homemade. I promise. *I whisk my sauce when heating to break up the jelly. Enjoy. Major comfort food"
5,these were good. I used 1/2 jar grape jelly one bottle of chili sauce and one back of regular meatballs. Will make again next time i have a party.
3,too sweet for me
5,"Made this last night with the following adjustments: browned the beef with the taco seasoning to give it more flavor, used a 10.75 oz. can of tomato soup instead of the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, added a packet of ranch dressing, only used 1 can of beans, used 1 can of ""southwestern style"" diced tomatoes (diced tomatoes and jalapenos) and 1 can of regular diced tomatoes, and only added 1 cup of water. It was perfect  -- had a great consistency (not too thick, not too runny) and was spicy but not too hot. Definitely add a dollop of sour cream! Delicious!"
5,"Best taco soup I&apos;ve ever made!  I made it a day early and took it to an office lunch (oh, was much better the second day), and it got raves.  I did make a few small changes to the recipe, but nothing substantive...I browned the ground beef with chopped onion and garlic.  I used a can of diced tomatoes that had jalapeno peppers mixed in, instead of a separate can of chili peppers.  Omitted the water and added a second can of tomato sauce, and substituted black beans for kidney beans.  The final addition...was a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, instead of the corn water.  As I said, it got raves, and this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Janeen!"
4,"This recipe is a good base but I felt it needed some spicing up.  I sauted the onions and about a teaspoon of garlic with the meat.  I also added the dressing and the taco seasoning to the meat before adding to the crock pot.  I tasted the mix before adding water and felt it was too bland, so I added extra cumin and chili powder and a bottle of Mexican beer rather than water.  I think the beer really made a big difference.  I also served with cheese, sour cream, onions, and cheddar-jalepeno beer bread.  I will probably make this again as it was a good start to the chili."
5,"What an awesome, simple recipe!!  It can cook well over 8 hours, too.  I made mine with ground turkey and the beef was never missed!  Thanks for the recipe!"
5,Five stars because this is very easy really tasty super economical can feed a crowd and makes great leftovers. By the time all the ingredients were added my 4-quart crockpot was completely full. This is a HUGE amount of food! All I had on hand was chicken taco spices but it worked just fine (with a little extra salt & pepper while browning the hamburger). We topped ours with shredded Colby-Jack and lite sour cream and warmed our tortilla chips on a cookie sheet at 350 for 3-4 minutes for extra crunch and flavor. YUM!!
5,"Excellent and Easy!  I added a package of Ranch Dip mix as well.  Once meat was brown, sprinkled a bit of the taco mix & ranch mix in to flavor the meat some.  Left out the corn and didn&apos;t miss it.  But added a small can of diced jalapeno peppers as well as the green chili peppers (they really have no heat to them!) and it was rather spicy.  Might suggest 1/3 to 1/2 can of jalapenos for the tentative!  Used black beans also...very good!  Cheese, sour cream, and tortilla chips a must have!!"
4,This is a nice recipe for the winter! I like to use black beans instead of chili beans and ground turkey instead of beef. Yummy!
3,This tasted just like chili and nothing like tacos.  I won&apos;t be making this one again.  My husband is not a chili lover for some reason.
4,Soup was very good. I also added the ranch dressing packet. I added too many green chiles and the family thought it was a little too spicy but very tasty.
5,"This recipe was fantastic!  Everyone in my family loved it.  I was a bit concerned because this was my very first time using a slow cooker, and the directions say ""cook on low for 4 hours"", whereas in my crockpot (Rival 6 qt oval time programmable) the 4 hour option is in the ""high"" temp.  It wasn&apos;t a problem at all.  4 hours was the perfect amount of time for my 2.69 lb pork loin.  I followed the instructions to the letter because the ingredients seemed perfect---and they were.  For the wine, I used the wine I was drinking that night---a cabernet sauvignon.  Also, halfway through the cooking time I did stab the pork a couple of times so that the sauce would seep in.  I served this with some mashed potatoes (perfect side dish because there was plenty of sauce left over). I did thicken the sauce a bit after the pork was cooked and had been taken out of the slow cooker.  I used 2 tbsp of cornstarch and enough water to dissolve it and remove any lumps.  I poured this into the crockpot and stirred for a minute and let it sit in a high temp for 10 min.  It was great---a definite keeper!"
5,"I wish I could give this 6 stars.  My husband made obscene noises when he tasted it and my daughter who is sick and has no appetite even ate a large helping.  Here is what I did - we are not big garlic people, so I made a dry rub of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder and rubbed the tenderloin down.  Then I seared it in a pan before putting it in the crockpot.  The rest of the ingredients, I mixed them all in a bowl (used the liquid to deglaze the pan I seared in for the heck of it), and poured that over the pork.  When it was done (cooked it for 6 hours on low), I poured the juices in a saucepan, brought them to a boil, and added flour and water to make gravy.  Amazing is right!"
4,"Good, simple recipe which turned out excellent with a few additions.
                                My only major change was in replacing the dry onion soup with a fresh onion, cut in rings.To the cup of water, I added a tsp. of beef stock. My choice of wine was what I had... a Chianti. Other than that, it came down to adding a bit more flavor. I added rosemary, thyme, celery powder, a splash of worcestershire, granulated garlic and parsley. Cook time was right on, and the Tenderloin was ""melt in your mouth."" Strained the onion into the au jus to thicken the gravy slightly, (which was delish,) and served with mashed potatoes. Thanks for the post, LLAU."
5,"WOW!  This is the best thing I&apos;ve ever made in the crock pot!  I almost always make a recipe exactly as it states the first time, and then make my modifications.  After reading a couple of reviews that complained about it being bland, I decided that I was going to put slivers of garlic in the roast before cooking it.  I LOVE garlic, and ended up using half a head (yeah, that&apos;s not a typo) throughout the roast.  If you&apos;ve never done it before, all you do is stab the roast and shove a clove or half a clove in the slit.  This way the flavor permeates the meat.  Anyway, I used LOW SODIUM soy sauce and everything else as stated.  It was done and super tender after the four hours, but I cooked it on low for about another half hour then kept it on warm until my husband came home.  I decided to add a little corn starch to thicken the juices, and man, was this roast incredible!  I could cut the meat with my fork!  Everyone should absolutely try this once!"
2,"How foolish of me, an experienced cook, to even contemplate trying this recipe. What a way to ruin a beautiful (and expensive) pork tenderloin. Let&apos;s save crock potting for the less tender cuts of meat.  Smelled heavenly but tasted oh so mediocre.  Sorry for the bad review. Different strokes for different folks I guess."
5,"My family loved this dish, even our picky eaters!  The recipe calls for it to be cooked for 4 hours on LOW.  Reviewers have reported out in a variety of ways on the setting issue.  However, I can tell you that it was not done at that setting.  I had to jack up the heat to HIGH and dinner was late.  Next time, I will cook it for 4 hours on HIGH."
5,"Quite a few said that this recipe was too salty.  I make my own dry onion soup mix (equals 1 packet) -- 8 tsp. dried onion flakes, 1 1/2 tsp. dried parsley, 1 tsp. onion powder, 1 tsp. tumeric, 1/2 tsp. celery seed, 1/2 tsp. sugar, and 1/4 tsp. ground pepper.  Hope this helps."
3,"At the risk of sounding like a know it all I should like to pass along a few hints about salt content on this recipe. Dry onion soup is high in salt and also  contains MSG another salt/flavour enhancer. Better to use either a sliced fresh onion  or 1T of dehydrated onions and a cup of low sodium beef broth. Soy sauce is another source of high sodium; the alternative is low salt soy sauce. For a crust, roll the tenderloin in salt free crackers and potato flakes mixed with herbs de provence (basil,parsley,marjoram,chevril and oregano) or herbs of your choice. For those who want that extra kick of salt add it to your own serving at the table."
5,"One of our family faves. So easy to make, and so tasty, and the best part is it&apos;s in the slow cooker, so you can get out and enjoy the day!
                                I see a lot of people are complaining that it is too salty, but I didn&apos;t think so, the trick may be to use a good red wine, not a cooking wine, as those are loaded with sodium!"
5,"We live in Mexico and this is AS CLOSE TO AUTHENTIC as possible.  I love ""cheater"" recipes like this.  Open a few cans, dump it in, and wa-la!  In Mexico we buy the right variety of peppers, cook them down, throw them in the blender, etc to make meals like this.  This saves all that hassle for a genuine taste.  My entire family says it&apos;s as good as the tortilla soups served here in local restaurants.  That&apos;s the highest compliment a recipe can be given!  Don&apos;t bother cooking the chicken ahead of time.  Throw it in with the rest in the beginning and shred it 2-3 hours later.   Hint:  serve with lime juice, a tsp of sour cream, chopped avocados, or pork rind along with the cheese to really eat it like a Mexican.  BTW, I bought bagged tortilla chips and worked fine."
5,"This was a hit!  Super easy and very tasty.  I threw in a couple of frozen chicken breasts rather than cooking them first and saved myself a step.  (I shredded them towards the end.)  I also used bagged tortilla chips instead of making my own.  I&apos;m all about ""easy"".  :0)"
3,"This recipe would be a little more authentic if you skip the canned enchilada sauce and instead made your own. VERY EASY. Take 3-4 large dried ancho chiles (cut off the stems and remove the seeds) and boil them with a cup or so of water, garlic and onion. After a half hour, whir it all together in your blender with a small can of tomato puree. Add some cumin if you like. Salt to taste. I live in Mexico, and believe me, there is NO such thing as canned enchilada sauce here. Also - the shredded or sliced chicken is usually added as a garnish here, not cooked in the soup."
5,"This was FABULOUS!!!  I used 1 qt. of chicken stock in lieu of broth and water, tossed in 3 raw chicken breasts (shredding 3 1/2 hours after cooking on high in the slow-cooker), doubled the garlic, used frozen roasted corn (Trader Joe&apos;s) and added 2 cups cooked brown rice (added the same time as the shredded chicken).  I topped each bowl served with shredded chedder, sliced green onions, a couple of cilantro leaves, the tortilla strips (be sure to make your own!) and chunks of ripe avocado.  I also added a couple of shakes of Tapatio (hot sauce) to my own bowl as I wanted more kick than my husband - who had thirds.  I can&apos;t wait to share this recipe!"
5,"Wonderful!  Definitely cook the chicken in the soup as suggested by previous reviewers.  This soup will only be hot and spicy if you use hot ingredients - I used mild enchilada sauce, etc. and my kids asked me to make it spicier next time - go figure! I also omitted the salt and used low salt products.  Used a 2nd can of chicken broth in place of the water.  Store bought tortilla chips are the way to go - try melting some sharp cheddar on the chips before adding to the soup along with a sprinkle of fresh cilantro and a dollup of sour cream - yum!"
5,"Amazing soup!!  I took advise of other reviewers and added black beans - definitely a good idea.  Also tossed in chicken still frozen and shredded about an hour before serving - worked like a charm.  Just finished the leftovers yesterday and I can&apos;t wait to make again!! Tortilla strips are easier with cooking spray instead of oil and I like to add salt, garlic powder and a little cumin to them before baking."
2,This recipe unfortunately is only worth two stars--barely. Too watery too spicy and tasted just like liquid enchiladas. And except for using broth instead of water which really should have helped this and black beans rather than corn I prepared this as the recipe directed. I had to try and save it! To start with I removed the majority of the liquid from the slow cooker and replaced it with chicken broth--better but there still was no substance to the soup. So I cooked a cup of rice and added it to the soup at the end and...now we&apos;re talking! MUCH better--now it&apos;s FIVE stars. I topped each serving with sour cream which really mellowed it out and added a rich creaminess shredded cheddar cheese and the tortilla crisps (which by the way didn&apos;t EVEN need 10-15 minutes so watch them carefully!) Now I had a soup that was not only palatable but it was just delicious. But the effort I had to put into it to make it so was too much trouble a waste of some ingredients and just simply not worth it. The soup I ended up with was downright delicious--but it was not THIS recipe.
5,"Started this Friday morning for our church small group meeting Friday night. The house smelled great! I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and 2 more cups of chicken broth to make it soupier. I put ""sides"" in bowls  for guests to make their own versions (shredded cheese, fresh avocado, and sour cream). Used plain tortilla chips that guests could sprinkle over their own bowls, and made  a pot of brown rice. Add a scoop of rice to your bowl, then put soup on top, then add your choice of sour cream, avocado, and/or cheese, and mix together. Yummy and great for a cold night!"
5,"This is one of my favorite soup recipes. I didnt have any plain tomatoes so I put in a can of rotel with green chilies, a can of black beans and a can of white beans.I didnt think my kids would like it.They loved this soup.Its a no fail recipe. Thanks A +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
5,"EXCELLENT!  This will be a regular on my recipe rotation.  I took the recommendations from many of the other comments:
                                - 1 can chopped tomatoes with chiles in place of one can of soup
                                - 1 can white beans instead of red kidney (I don&apos;t like the red ones)
                                - 1 can of corn (great addition and adds color!)
                                - 1 (4oz) can green chiles
                                - 1/2 can extra water
                                - I cooked the onion with the meat
                                
                                I browned the onion and meat the night before and put measured out the spices into a bowl. In the morning, it took less than 10 minutes to throw it all together and go.  My husband had 3 bowls!  Thanks for the great recipe."
4,"This is a great base for a slow cooker turkey chili. If you omit the red pepper flakes and replace one can of the tomato soup with a can of tomatoes with green chilis, this recipe is VERY kid friendly. When I want a more spicy version (I love spicy food!), I only add between 1/4 and 1/2 teaspoons of the red pepper flakes. An entire teaspoon simmering all day in a slow cooker will blow out your sinuses! In addition to the black beans, I also used both dark and light red kidney beans to make it more festive. This recipe is a keeper in my recipe box. Thanks!"
5,"This is great chili! I made two pots two cold days in a row! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers: I used one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis in place of one can of tomato soup. I cut the chili powder in half (it was still spicy!), added a bit of water, and added jalepenos. Yum!"
5,"I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars! Absolutely delicious! I took the advice of some others and only added 1 can of tomato soup, but also put in 2 cans of diced tomatoes. We like spicy food so I added some diced green chiles and a couple of chopped jalapeno peppers. My husband HATES ground turkey, but he had seconds of this chili. Thanks so much for a healthy recipe that tastes like its not!
                                I could seriously eat this twice a week and not get tired of it... YUMMY!!!"
5,This is one spicy chili! I only used one can of kidney beans - 2 cans would have been overload also used the other suggestions and used one can tomato soup and one can diced tomatoes with green chiles...added 1/2 can of water so I had no complaints on it being too thick. Also added a few sprinkles of hot sauce - not sure if that is what made it extra spicy or just the fact I added a little more than the 2 Tbsp of Chili powder. Omitted allspice and you would never know. I would have to say this is a keeper but would definitely NOT give it to my 2 1/2 year old much to spicy! Perfect with bread a little cheese and sour cream!
4,This was wonderful. I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes for the tomato soup. Perfect meal for a chili (haha)day.
5,our very first time making chili and it came out so good! we like it SPICY so we added one habernero pepper seeded & chopped one small can of diced jalapenos and half a tablespoon of tobasco. i was worried at first that the jalapenos would be overkill but all that time in the slow cooker seemed to mellow the flavors while infusing them into everything. also added diced fresh red and green bell peppers and replaced the tomato soup with diced tomatoes. our neighbors who used to run a restaurant in baja loved it! and so healthy on top of everything. this is a keeper!
4,I thought this was GREAT!  The only thing I changed was I added a can of chopped tomatoes instead of one of the cans of tomato soup.  It was a little thicker than I would have liked but was still great especially for dipping with tortillas.  Next time I will use more spices - I like my chili a bit spicier.  Overall a great spin on chili.
5,Didn&apos;t have measuring spoons (we just moved and I can&apos;t find half my stuff) so I guess-timated and it still turned out great.  My boyfriend had two huge servings and took the rest for lunch today at work.  Easy recipe.  We topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and crumbled crackers.  YUM!
3,I liked the chili but it was a little lacking on flavor. It could be because the turkey was leftovers and not freshly made. I would make it again.
5,"Absolutely AWESOME!!! The prep couldn&apos;t have been easier, and the house smelled wonderful all day.  To save others some time, I read most of the 150+ reviews, and here are the most consistent suggestions that I believe made the recipe: 1) Use a chuck roast instead of rump, as it shreds better (and is cheaper!).  2) Subsitute beef broth for the water  3) Double the salad dressing mix 4) After shredding the beef, put it back in the crockpot to cook an additional half hour to soak in the juices.
                                I only used a 2 1/2 pound chuck roast, but I used the amount of spices called for a 5 lb. one, and it was just perfect.  I cooked on low for 10 hours, and around the 8 hour mark I took the meat out to shred it and it was so easy, it practically fell apart.  I put it back in and it cooked for another hour and a half along with a couple pepperoncini before we finally got to eat.  I served on toasted hoagie rolls with a bunch of optional toppings....sauteed mushrooms, red onion, sliced pepperoncini and sliced roasted red peppers. Then ran the sandwiches under the broiler to melt the extra sharp provolone cheese.  My husband was in heaven and if we weren&apos;t already married I think this sandwich would have gotten me a proposal!  
                                I had never heard of Italian Beef before, but this recipe makes me want to visit Chicago to try theirs!  Thank you for another permanent in our meal rotation!"
5,"Tasty and flavorful, as well as easy to make. There is an error in the list of ingredients: it calls for a 4.7 oz package dry Italian salad dressing mix. That would be way too much seasoning. The correct amount is a 0.7 oz package."
5,"Originally from the Chicago &apos;Burbs, I&apos;ve been looking for a good Italian Beef Sandwich recipe for AGES... and this one is the BEST I&apos;ve found, by far! It tastes almost exactly like the ones I used to get ""back home""... plus it&apos;s sooooo easy to make in the crockpot!
                                
                                I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted beef broth for the water and added 2 packages of the italian salad dressing mix.  I also added a few sliced green peppers to the crockpot an hour or so before it was done. When it was done, I removed the peppers, shredded the beef, and then returned the shredded beef back to the liquid in the crockpot. I then served the shredded beef and peppers on toasted hoagie rolls. My husband and I were in HEAVEN!! :)
                                
                                Oh, and here&apos;s a tip -- make sure you DON&apos;T drain the meat before placing it on the rolls -- the liquid has an AWESOME taste, so make sure you get plenty of it on your sandwich for the best flavor. In Chicago they say ""the wetter, the better"" when it comes to Italian Beef Sandwiches!!"
4,"Made these changes: omitted salt, substituted onion powder for onion salt, used 2 dressing mixes, added 1 1/2 tsp. dried onion, and added 2 beef bouillion cubes to the water.  Cooked on low for about 14 hours; shredded meat and refrigerated meat and juice separately overnight.  In the morning, I skimmed the fat off the juice, and returned the juice & meat to the slow cooker, along with some chopped green pepper, on high to reheat for a couple hours. Served with horseradish and provolone cheese. Was a hit at our family reunion! Leftovers (if any!) reheat well for a quick lunch."
5,"I moved from Chicago, and the thing I miss most is the food!  This is a great recipe for the Chicago food blues.  I, too, used the 2 pks of dressing mix (I even use the Italian dressing mix on this site), crushed red pepper, the juice (~1/8 c.) of some sweet and hot peppers, and sliced peppers and onions and serve it on warm Italian bread with mozzarella cheese (with the peppers and onions).  The best thing to do is to have it cook in the slow cooker until it is cooked through, then slice it thinly and return it to the juice for about an hour (just like they do at the beef restaurants).  It was a hit at my daughter&apos;s family birthday party, and took hardly any effort.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!"
5,This recipe was good as is but I now use it combined with 3 other recipes for french dip and it is great I use all of the ingredients in this recipe except use only 2 cups of water and leave out both the salt and onion salt I add 2 cups onion sliced thin sauted in 1/4 cup butter 1/2 cup soy sauce 1 can coke do not use diet or an off brand 1 12 oz. can dark beer 1 can beef broth 1 can condesned french onion soup campbells is best I use the zesty soup mix. I try to get at least a 5 to 6 pound roast rump is o.k. if its choice otherwise I use a sirlion tip roast this is much cheaper and less fat than a regular sirlion. I also add italian seasoning basil oregano thyme and white pepper. I slice the meat very thin like a french dip. update I have started leaving the water out and adding another can of low sodium beef broth.
5,"Made this for a casual supper last night and all who ate it said it was the best beef sanwich ever.  I followed advice of others and used 2 cups beef broth and one cup water; also two packages of Italian dressing mix.  My butcher suggested a chuck roast as it shreds more easily for sandwiches.  Slow cooked it and served with optional provolone cheese, thin-sliced red onion, mustard/mayo sauce and horseradish. Buy really good fresh rolls. Soooo yummy and sooo easy - THANKS!"
4,"While the beef was moist and tender, there was way too much salt and pepper to make the broth suitable for dipping.  I ended up diluting it with about 2 cups of water.  Next time I&apos;ll eliminate the salt (canned broth is salty enough)and cut the ground pepper in half.  Otherwise, the Italian beef taste was definitely there and very good.  For the person in Phoenix, try Luke&apos;s at 16th Street and Indian School for their Italian beef.  It&apos;s the closest thing I&apos;ve found to the real stuff.  A suggestion for another reviewer: If you want the beef sliced rather than shredded, make it the day before.  After a night in the fridge, slice it across the grain and gently warm it in the broth."
5,"This is fantastic! I&apos;ve had so many people request this recipe. I&apos;m really glad I found this recipe. I grew up in Chicago where you can order this anywhere you can buy pizza or a hot dog, but here in Phoenix no one has ever heard of it. It&apos;s my little taste of home. This is even better when you replace the water with chicken broth."
2,"Not very impressive, I used beef broth and two packets of Italian and it was still kind of bland!  It was too expensive to make for the result we got.  so disappointed"
5,"Hey everyone! I&apos;m the person that posted this recipe and I appreciate all the feedback (good and bad) along with what everyone did to make it their own. I read over some of the recommendations, and this is what I did to make this recipe even better. I replaced the water with Pepsi, added about a tsp of liquid smoke, and seasoned the ribs with a rub of salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and brown sugar. Added the onion and garlic as stated in the recipe, and cooked them on high for just under 4 hours and followed the rest of the directions. With these changes, I love the recipe even more (though as many people have stated, it&apos;s pretty excellent as written)! I know that many people love them to &apos;fall off the bone&apos;, but good ribs should still have a nice bite and pull when you bite into them. Adjust the cooking time accordingly, but for my slow cooker, they are cooked perfectly between 3.5 and 4 hours. Thanks again for all the feedback!! ~Norah"
5,"I was really skeptical about ribs in a slow cooker, so I tried this recipe twice to make sure that the first time wasn&apos;t a fluke.  I am a convert, that&apos;s for sure.  These were amazing! First time, I made it exactly as the recipe called for and these ribs were fall off the bone good.  The second time, I added smoked paprika and garlic powder to the rub on the ribs before I put them in the slow cooker.  I also used 1/2 cup of beer instead of the water (any liquid will add flavour).  I cooked them on high in the slow cooker for 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I covered a 9 x 11 baking dish with tin foil (to help with clean up) and put the ribs in the uncovered baking dish.  I coated the ribs with bbq sauce and put them in the oven at 350F for 20 minutes.  I pulled the ribs out and added another thin layer of bbq sauce before putting them back in the oven under the broiler for 7 to 10 minutes to get that crust on the top.  The ribs were perfect.  My family thanks you for this recipe which I will be using again and again!  Amanda"
4,These ribs were really good- I was surprised as the recipe was very simple and didn&apos;t take much time. My whole family really enjoyed these!
5,"Marinade the night before with red wine vinegar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, olive oil, minced garlic and Dijon mustard. Then follow recipe as is."
5,"Slow cooking makes the difference here.  Instead of finishing in the oven, I basted with sauce and placed them on a medium-heat grill for 15-20 minutes.  Turn every 5 minutes and baste the meaty side 1-2 more times until desired level of caramelization (is that a word?).  Great recipe! We will use it every time we make ribs."
4,"This is an excellent ""cheater"" recipe for the most part.  Still, it fell from perfection because the cooking time was too long. Hubs and I do far too much rib eating in our travels and one thing we&apos;ve learned from the experts is that, contrary to popular belief, you don&apos;t WANT your ribs to fall off the bone.  If that&apos;s the state they end up in they&apos;ve been cooked too long (or stewed).  We like our ribs tender, yet with the meat still clinging to the bone.  I cooked them just short of 4 hours on high, and if I do this again I&apos;d shorten that by an hour.  The finish in the oven, however, was just right - 15 minutes at 375 degrees resulted in a sticky, caramelized,  glazed exterior.  I didn&apos;t bother with either the onion or garlic, but I did season them with a good rub seasoning a few hours before I started them in the Crock Pot.  The bottom line?  In spite of not being smoked or grilled, and in spite of too long a stint in the Crock Pot, these were some ""D"" fine ribs."
5,I have recently tried several BBQ rib recipes and this is the best one yet. I made it exactly the way the recipe was written and they were falling off the bone delicious!!
5,"I made these today and they were INCREDIBLE.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one addition.  I marinated the ribs overnight in a mixture of Worchestershire, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, and sea salt.  I served them with loaded baked potatoes, homemade rolls, and salad. Thanks for the fantastic recipe.  I will definitely make my ribs like this from now on!!"
3,"Not bad, but the rib meat didn&apos;t have much flavor. If I try it again, I think I would marinate the meat overnight, and use a can of beer instead of water, to add more flavor."
2,Didn&apos;t do much for us. Wouldn&apos;t repeat.
3,I thought this was a pretty good soup. I didn&apos;t add the artichokes though. I blended half of it up a little for the kids and I liked it that way too. Next time I make it and I will I will add more spices
4,My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe! The recipe called for the turkey to be cubed but I chose to shred it for my own personal prefrence. I didn&apos;t have any artichoke hearts so I left them out but I added some frozen corn for color. I also added black beans in addition to the chick peas. For presentation I garnished it with chopped cilantro and Mexican crumbling cheese. Delicious! I will definitely make this dish again!
4,Made this for a weeknight dinner and it was very tasty! I didn&apos;t have the exact vegetables called for so I subbed zucchini for the yellow squash and red pepper for the green. I thought 4 cups was a lot so used about 2 1/2. This seemed to be the right amount. I also added some garlic. The only thing that seemed a little strange was the garbanzo beans. They weren&apos;t bad; just not really necessary. I served this over a pile of rice in soup bowls and everyone enjoyed it. Healthy and filling and leftovers for lunch. Planning to make it again!
5,i didn&apos;t add the artichoke hearts
5,"We used chicken instead of the turkey. Also, we added taco flavored mix. Finally, we used cilantro."
5,I made this with the exception of adding potatoes to the crock pot.  I thought it was a welcome change from my normal crock pot roast.  I also thought the peppers were a nice addition to the roast.  I will make it again.
5,"This is one pot recipe I&apos;ve used many times.  Recently I did a small group taste test with Mississippi Pot Roast and another well known and loved pot roast.  When they were side by side the Mississippi Pot Roast was the clear winner. 
                                
                                I do recommend searing the Roast prior to the crockpot cooking."
5,Don’t put it in the crock pot without browning it on all sides first. If you don’t itll get tough while cooking
4,Agree with the butter reco and even as I like salt you can go easy on it as the packets and pepperoncinis have plenty of it included.  Also you want sliced pepperoncinis.  Recipe didn&apos;t seem to specify that.
5,"I’ve made this with a stick of butter, packet of ranch & au ju gravy packet on top of the roast & it is delicious!"
4,I make mine very similar except put potatoes and baby carrots on the bottom then the roast then sprinkle on the ranch and au jus finally add the peppers and juice. My only real change is to lay a stick of unsalted butter on top. I very seldom eat any meat and even I think this is super delicious.
5,"This roast is perfect! We make this often , it&apos;s great over mashed potatoes or wild rice. I have also had it on a crusty roll with a slice of provolone and put under the broiler! My sister has made this with chicken and it was also delicious."
1,"DO NOT ADD CARROTS! I added veggies as a lot of reviewers did but the carrots are horrible! They tasted pickled andwe did not care for them at all! The meat was nice and tender and may have worked but because the vegetables absorbed the pepper liquid, the meal was ruined. We ordered pizza. (I totally understand that the recipe did not ask you to add vegetables and the fault lies with me for changing it.)"
5,"I made this tonight, and it was incredible.  The roast was tender beyond comparison.  The mixture of au jus, ranch, and pepperocinni gave it a deep flavor that ends with a little kick.
                                
                                I made it a 2nd time and added a hack...  After the beef was done I shredded it into a  casserole dish, added in some of the Au Jus gravy, threw a bag of mixed veggies on top, then topped it all off with mashed potatoes and twice baked it on 350 for 30 minutes and it was even more perfect."
5,"I used this recipe for my first roast and have used it religiously since.  My only advice would be to watch your cooking time.  My roasts have always been done between 5-6 hours (on low) and they come out very tender.  Overall, a very easy and tasteful recipe."
5,"I did add some garlic powder for flavor. I used beef broth instead of water and bouillon cubes and used more carrot and potatoes than called for (I used small red potatoes cut into half). I also used low sodium mushroom soup. I would like to add that different slow cookers work at different temperatures. I have two slow cookers and one cooks at a MUCH higher temperature on both low and high setting than the other.  I would keep this in mind when setting up your cooking times. The lady that wrote this recipe has a cooker that will either be slower or faster than the one you have. As for the finished product.... Mine was outstanding! I let each person added salt and pepper to their own taste after it was cooked... It&apos;s much easier to control the amount of salt and pepper at the table than to guess how much it will take when you start cooking. After cooking on low for nine hours, my roast (2.8 pounds) was so tender I could cut it with a fork. Both my wife and I commented how tasty it turned out. This is an easy and very tasty recipe for pot roast and I recommend anyone likes a good pot roast!"
5,"I don&apos;t know what some of these people are talking about - this was a great roast! You may want to add some more spices, but that&apos;s not rocket science. I added a litte bit of garlic, a sprinkle of garlic salt, ground pepper and extra onion flakes. My boyfriend and I loved it - it was a nice brown color, and the aroma filled the house when I came home. I will be using this recipe over and over."
3,"This is good made as directed, but I felt it needed a little more flavor / complexity.  I use a larger roast (5 lbs) rubbed with salt, pepper, garlic, dredged in flour (to thicken the gravy later) and seared in olive oil.  For the liquid... beef broth, and I add a few big splashes of red wine (about half a cup).  Also put in onion, fresh minced garlic, a couple of rosemary sprigs and a tsp of coriander seeds.  Cooked carrots with the roast, but potatoes separately (roasted potatoes, as I don&apos;t like everything to taste the same or to be too mushy.)  YUMMO!"
4,This has to be the easiest way to make pot roast. I will brown my meat before placing in the crock pot and the deglaze the pan with the beef broth. After I take all the meat and vegetables out I will thicken the gravy with a little corn starch and water. It is every bit as good as a roast cooked in the oven.
5,"My first time using a slow cooker and this turned out fantastic! I cooked a 2-1/2 lb roast for 5 hours on high, stirring twice to make sure the beef bouillons were mixed in evenly (I used Maggi brand). Beforehand, I made slits in the roast and put in slices of garlic, then browned the roast on all sides before putting it in the slow cooker. I also added a bay leaf, ground pepper and 2/3 cups water and wished I added more because the ""juice"" was so good! Perfect for soaking up with freshly baked bread!"
5,"Wow harsh review, I think there may have been something wrong with your cooker or something because I cant imagine the veggies being raw after hours and hours of slow cooking, but hope you find the recipe your looking for! As far as my experience with the recipe, I tweaked it a little for my own taste. I used broth instead of buillion and water, and I used a lot of it because I love the soupy gravy. I added the potatoes in half way through cooking so they wouldnt be mush,  they were perfect! Added probably more veggies than recommended and some extra seasoning (garlic, tonys). But overall I just loved it! thanks for the recipe!"
5,This was my first pot roast ever and I was pretty apprehensive... but it turned out great! I prepared it according to the directions with the following modifications: I sliced 3 carrots instead of using baby carrots replaced the onion with a package of dry onion soup mix and used 3/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup. I cooked it on low for a little over 8 hours. The meat was so tender and so full of flavor. Plus it passed the ultimate test: my husband loved it and even had seconds! Next time I&apos;m going to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to make a thicker gravy. Great recipe!
4,"As newlyweds and new to cooking this was THE EASIEST and the best recipe......i think tonite was the first time we ate a real meal before 7PM and done by 8!!!
                                Using the Advice from the previous reviews i added the xtra 1/4 cup of water, bay leaf, and also browned it before putting in the crock......It turned out very nicely and my inlaws thought it was delicious!!! I made gravy from the crock pot juices by adding flour, salt, pepper and some onion powder all to taste.........YUM!!!!"
5,"Ok so I gave it 5 stars as a basic recipe but I use all low fat ingredients and also I can&apos;t imagine how you cook the noodles first and they dont get mushy. I use the crock pot daily and know you don&apos;t need to so I don&apos;t make it this complicated. I like easy and low mess. I take butter (I use only about 1/4 of stick) rub it around the sides and leaf it in the middle. Dump the noodles (uncooked), milk (though I use the larger can of reduced fat condensed and the less than 2 cups of skim milk),cheddar soup and salt and pepper in the crockpot. I mix 1 egg in the cup I measured the milk in with that fork and add to crockpot. Then I stir it all up. And half the cheese and walk away. After an hour and half on low I add the other half of the cheese and its done around 2-2.5 hrs and the noodles are cooked fine and its plenty cheesy. Adding the cheese towards the end allows the noodles to cook and keeps the cheese from getting that weird curdled texture. If i wanted it creamier I&apos;d add more butter or milk I guess but its great like this. 5 stars because I couldn&apos;t have concocted it without this to start with and this with some bacon in it is my family&apos;s favorite."
5,"I made this on Easter 2014.  I usually don&apos;t try a recipe the first time with company coming over, but it sounded like it would be good.  I wasn&apos;t disappointed.  It was perfect!  It was creamy and cheesy and exactly  what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a mixture of Sharp and Medium Cheddar Cheese.  This will be the Macaroni and Cheese that I will be making for Christmas when everyone comes over.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe."
5,"Recipe turned out really good.  I was skeptical since there was only a few reviews (I tend to rely on them alot) but I made it anyway for a cookout and I got several compliments and there wasn&apos;t a noodle left to take home.  I used shell pasta and boiled it about 1/2 done.  I used 3/4 stick of butter (since a whole stick seemed like a lot) and I used only about 3/4 of the cheese (again, it just seemed like a lot to me).  I accidentally bought the large can of evaporated milk and noticed after adding it to the pasta.  So I just used 1 cup of 2% milk instead of the 2 cups.  I used Campbell&apos;s nacho cheese soup which gave it a little extra kick.  I will probably try using 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 pepper jack next time to give it even more spice.  Cooked on low about 2 hours and stirred a few times while cooking.  I was really impressed with the outcome."
2,"I have made this exact recipe given to me by a friend that swore it was to die for.  I didn&apos;t like it, I prefer baked mac&c w/bread crumbs on top.  I have used the cheddar cheese soup in a baked mac&c dish to try another version of it and it turned out ok, but I always go back to my standard recipe that I like.
                                
                                The thing is w/crock pots if I have to do any pre-cooking, or browning etc. to me that defeats the purpose of crock pot cooking.  I like recipes where I put everything at once in the crock pot and just turn it on, that is what makes it easy.  If I have to saute, brown, boil, items I may as well just use the stove and pots and pans."
5,"I would give this recipe a 10 if I could!  I made this for a friends wedding, so I changed the servings to 96...yes 96!  This was THE biggest batch of anything I&apos;ve ever made in my life!  I was forced to make some ingredient changes because the store I went to didn&apos;t have enough cheddar cheese soup, so I ended up using Sharp Velveeta instead and the texture and flavor were great!  I don&apos;t think there was one person at the wedding that didn&apos;t ask who made it and what the recipe was!  As you can tell I highly recommend this very forgiving, delicious recipe!  Thanks Cathy P. for sharing!"
5,Delicious and easy!!
4,"I used this recipe as a starting point. It came out great! Didn&apos;t cook pasta, used whole wheat and regular mixed. I try to avoid canned stuff, so I replaced the condensed cheese soup with 10 ounces of water and an extra 1/2 cup cheese. I used 8 oz of cheddar and about 10 oz of a combination of Parmesan, mozzarella, Asiago, and feta (I had them in the fridge). Also added 1 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp each cayenne, mustard powder,  nutmeg and paprika, and omitted the salt. Because I was home, I added the cheddar in the last hour of cooking as recommended by others. I&apos;ll probably make another batch next week! Thank you, Cathy P!"
5,It&apos;s a very nice easy recipe. I deleted the butter with the exception of buttering the slow cooker before adding the ingredients. There is plenty fat in the cheese. I replaced the eggs with 2 Tablespoons of flour. My suggestion is to delay adding the top layer of cheese until half way through the cooking time. Give it a stir then add the top layer of cheese. Old cheddar may curdle so use mild or medium. Also I mixed it all in the slow cooker to reduce dish washing. I wish that the measures were in metric units.
5,"The last time I cooked for a potluck at work my dish ended up being cold and therefore not as tasty as it should be.  I was asked to make Mac and cheese for today, which I usually bake but I wanted to use a slow cooker so it would be hot.  I was dubious about this but I gave it a try and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy enough to just throw together this morning and it was hot and ready by lunch.   This one is definitely going into my cookbook.  I think it would be even better with some spicer cheeses if you are into that kind of thing but for a group potluck this dish as it is was a hit!"
5,"I have made this recipe at least 15 times.  What I have found that the best cut of meat to use is a tri-tip roast. There is no need to brown the meat but I do recommend triming off as much fat as possible.  
                                One problem I had was that there was always too much gravy left over. I have recently discovered  that this recipe comes out just as spectacular using one can of soup and half a can of water. Do use the regular amount of onion soup mix.  It should be cooked to perfection in about six hours.
                                I also have a suggestion on  the type of slowcooker used.  I first tried making this recipe in a small Nesco but it was not able to keep the roast completely immersed in the soup mixture.  I use a Rival.  It is 7 inches wide and about 5 inches deep. This is the most typical slowcooker around.  
                                Finally a word on adding vegetables.  I tried adding carrots and potatoes to this recipe and for some reason the gravy was not very flavorful. For this reason I just leave them out.
                                Good luck!"
5,"If you are looking for the perfect roast recipe then look no further!  I read pages and pages of the reviews & then took some of the suggestions and modified the recipe a bit.  The result was spectacular – I will be making this dish again and again.  Since there are just two of us I bought a 2.5 lb chuck roast and I lightly covered with a mixture of flour, garlic salt and dried rosemary and then seared all sides with a bit of unsalted butter.  I added baby carrots, sweet onion, small red potatoes and celery.  For the gravy I combined 2 cans of 99%fat free cream of mushroom soup, ½ a packet of onion soup mix, 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce, ¼ cup of red wine and 1 cup of beef broth & cooked on high for 4 hours and low for 2 hours.  The meat was so tender and the gravy was absolutely delectable.  It was a bit thin so I just thickened up with a bit of flour.  I served with cheese risotto (Safeway brand) and French bread.  I can honestly say this was one of the best meals I’ve ever made…. HIGHLY recommend."
5,"OK.... I tried this recipe using a 4 lb. angus bottom round roast, and after reading all the reviews that said the gravy needed to be thickened. I decided to flour the roast with flour, granulated garlic, salt and pepper. Then I browned it on all sides in a little olive oil. While it was browning on the stove, I added the rest of the ingredients to the slow cooker, I also put in two 4 oz. cans of mushrooms. However, I substituded the water for beef broth (same amount) and when the roast was done browning, I put it in the slow cooker and covered it with the mixture in the slow cooker. I also cooked it on low for 4 hours then high for the rest of the time. It came out VERY tender. No need to thicken the gravy, because the flour thickened it while it was cooking. My picky 12 yr old daughter (who eats like a bird) ate some for dinner, then again when she got home that night, and my 9 yr old son asked me to make this more often. I served it with mashed potatoes and canned corn. It was the easiest pot roast I ever made!!"
5,"BADA-BING!  I have been making this recipe for quite some time now, with the exception of the cream of mushroom soup.  The soup adds that OOMPH to the gravy that I have been looking for!  I used beef broth instead of the water, &  added 2 TBSP of corn starch to thicken it up before serving.  In the last 3 hours cooking in the crock pot I added fresh carrots, green beans, potatoes & sliced onions.  YUM!  The family LOVES it & when my neighbors find out I&apos;m making it, they always take dibs on the leftovers!  Thanks Brenda!!"
5,"I wasn&apos;t able to follow this recipe, since I didn&apos;t have the soup and onion mix. But I wanted to add a tip that makes cooking in a crockpot SO much easier. Line the crockpot with a Reynold&apos;s oven cooking bag, Turkey size, or smaller depending on the size of your crockpot. Cooking time is the same. Then the best part, clean up. Just remove the ingredients, lift out the bag, and your done! The crockpot remains clean."
5,"Best tasting pot roast I ever had. To make it a little healthier, I cooked it all day on low and then refrigerated it. The next evening I was able to peel off over a 1"" layer of beef fat that had hardened on the top and reheat the pot roast in the oven. I realize this defeated the &apos;dinner ready when you get home&apos; purpose of a crockpot but this process removed at least 1000 calories from the dish and it still tasted fantastic!"
5,Just an additional note to say that it&apos;s important to sear the meat on all sides before adding to the crockpot- it only takes a few minutes and really helps to seal in the juices of the meat.  I made it yesterday and forgot to sear the meat first.  Still tasted good but not nearly as moist as when I&apos;ve seared the roast first.  Enjoy!
5,"I seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and Lawry&apos;s Seasoning Salt.  I browned the roast on all sides in a hot skillet with a little olive oil in it. I transfered the roast to the slow cooker.  I added the water to the skillet and scraped up all the bits and pieces of meat that have so much flavor.  I substituted a package of dry ""au jus"" mix for the onion soup mix and blended this and the mushroom soup with the water in the skillet.  I put sliced onions on top of the roast, added some minced garlic, and poured the liquid over the roast.  The longer you cook it, the better it gets. It is a family favorite ~"
5,"This recipe is excellent and you can&apos;t really tell canned cream of mushroom soup was used for gravy.  A couple of things I substitute is an envelope of pre-packaged ""pot roast"" seasoning (McCormick&apos;s Bag &apos;n Season) instead of onion soup mix, and red burgundy wine instead of water.  I also add diced yukon gold potatoes, carrots, mushrooms and sliced onions at the bottom of the crockpot.  Cooking time for a 4-lb. roast is usually 9 hours on Low and the longer the better.  I thicken the gravy slightly with cornstarch and water at the very end.  Overall, very very good!"
1,"I thought maybe I did something wrong when I made this and it turned out terrible, but when my mom tried it and mentioned her horrible results, I decided it wasn&apos;t just me. I don&apos;t know why the reviews are so high, but this recipe isn&apos;t that great. The only thing that&apos;s great is that it&apos;s easy and quick to assemble. The flavor is pretty weak and the gravy was awful. I would never make this again and would rather do the extra work to have a roast that tastes yummy with gravy that IS gravy."
4,My husband has been hounding me for chicken cordon bleu for a while. However it&apos;s a little tough to make with a toddler and a newborn so I was happy to find this recipe. I used 4 large boneless breasts that I butterflied and stuffed each with a slice of ham and Swiss cheese. I used a box of Stove Top stuffing mix but only added 2 tablespoons of butter. It was a hit and my DH said he would be happy to have this every couple of weeks. We will definitely be eating this again.
4,True-this is not a true cordon bleu. But its a good recipe with the same idea of cordon bleu. And its a good crockpot recipe-which I am always trying to find a good crock pot recipe. If you want you can butterfly the chicken boneless chicken breast and stuff it with the ham & cheese. Or you can pound the breast flat and roll the ham & cheese in the chicken and lay it in the crockpot with the seal side down so that it doesnt come undone (use a toothpick if you are nervous about it-just besure to remove it before serving). And cook it that way. This isnt a bad recipe but I needed to add garlic and leeks to the pot. I live for spices. I will make it again and most likely butterfly the breasts and stuff them. But next time I may add some white wine to the mix.
5,I made this last night for company and it was a huge hit. Our friends wouldn&apos;t leave until we gave them a copy of this recipe. The one thing I did different was to butterfly the chicken and roll up the ham & cheese and stuff it inside. This worked perfectly to keep the cheese in. I will definately be making this again!!
5,"This recipe was a hit I snuck this in on a weeknight for the fiance that ""hates chicken cordon bleu"". She definitely does not hate it after this and even asked me to make it again. I did try it withe one BIG change. Instead of adding the box of stuffing I added a box of those cheap scalloped potatoes to the top and about half of the seasoning packet from the boxed potatoes. It turned out phenomenal!"
5,Based on the previous reviews I waited until the last 1-2 hours before I put the cheese and stuffing in and it turned out great! If you use larger chicken breats it&apos;s a little hard to serve out of the crock-pot so next time I may just cube the chicken and ham.
4,This slow cooker recipe needs some flavor enhancement but it was a hit with my company. When I make it again I will had some thyme and perhaps some garlic and I will use a crock pot liner as the bread crumbs stuck to the crock pot securely around the edges! Definitely will cook it again.
4,This was an amazing idea for what turned out to be a wonderful meal. I used ham chunks halved the chicken breasts added a can of chicken broth and half a minced onion...simmered all day. Thickened with a cornstach slurry. Layered in the swis cheese. Coated the stuffing with butter and topped the casserole...let it cook for another hour. So so so so yummy!
4,This Recipe was fantastic. I put the crockpot on high and it was done in just over 2 hours. It was a great first time crock pot experience. I was on weight watchers at the time; I replaced the milk with Skim milk LOW FAT cheese 1/2 fat soup margarine instead of butter and it was DELICIOUS. My fiancé LOVED it and he is not a half fat/diet type of guy. I only told him afterward
5,the stuffing really added to this recipe. I used turkey flavour which was left over from Christmas. I put some on earlier than added the last 1/2 package later because other reviewers thought it got soggy. Mine was cripsy and very nice.
3,Good not great. The chicken got so tender it fell apart which I was not expecting so that made it different than I had anticipated. It was pretty salty with the ham cream of chicken cheese butter and seasoning from the stuffing. I think next time I will omit the butter and instead pour the remaining soup over the stuffing. But I plan to make this again it&apos;s great cold-weather food.
4,"I give this recipe 4 starts simply due to the prep work this particular one entails. The soup tasted amazing! However, for ease of cooking, here are my tweaks: First, I sliced the onions, and tossed them in the butter which I melted, and placed them in the crock pot on low on their own to caramelize over night, 10-12 hours. I used salted butter, so I omitted the salt. I also omitted the sugar since they were caramelizing this way. SUPER EASY. The next morning, when the onions were good to go, I threw in the other cooking ingredients to cook for the day. I had no cooking sherry, so I used a 1/2 cup of dry red wine my husband opened the night before. I am a firm believer that if you don&apos;t drink it you shouldn&apos;t cook with it. And I had 2 quarts of beef stock, so I used that all up. No sense wasting a cup. When it came to the cheese, we used what we like, so that is personal taste not tweaking. I did find, however, that I needed to add a bit of salt and pepper to taste at the end just before serving, so make sure you taste it to ensure it is to your liking. But allowing the onions to cook and caramelize themselves cut the prep work down to the bare minimum of slicing the onions, measuring the ingredients, and getting the bread and cheese ready at the end. About 20 minutes total. You just need to start it the day before, which was worth it to me if it meant not standing over a stove for an hour. Family loved it, warms well for leftovers, which wasn&apos;t too much. Will make again!"
5,Excellent! I followed this recipe to the letter (with the exception of substituting the Gruyere and Emmental with provolone and Swiss) and the soup was to weep for. The smell drove us mad all day long: it was hard to wait 8 hrs! Thanks for the recipe!
4,"This is one of the better slow-cooker recipes I&apos;ve tried. Do take the time to carmalize the onions - the fond makes a lot of difference. Whatever else you do, please do not use &apos;cooking&apos; sherry, which isn&apos;t really sherry and tastes mainly like sour salt water. Use real cocktail (dry) sherry if you have it. If not, a little bourbon, red wine, or Mediera will do. And try to use the cheezes specified, but it you must substitute, regular Deli-style swiss and/or Provolone are better than Mozzerella, which is too bland and milky for the richness of the dish. Finally, I found that slow-baking the bread slices to dry them works better than toasting because the toasted bread is softer and will dissolve in the hot liquid too quickly."
4,"This is delicious but since you already spent 40 minutes cooking the onions on the stove and they are already nice and soft, why not just leave it on the stove and add the broth to that pot and simmer it for another hour or so? Transferring it to the slow cooker seems like an unnecessary step and just creates extra stuff to wash. This seems to be one of those recipes where using the slow cooker really doesn&apos;t simplify anything."
5,This is a great recipe. I couldn&apos;t find Emmental so I subbed in Swiss. If you put the bread right in the soup it kind of soaks it up and turns soggy so you can coop that right up with your spoon along with the soup - or if you don&apos;t like soggy bread you can not do that. The bread is definitely key though.
3,"Even more ridiculously easy: Caramelize the onions in the, lightly-oiled, crock pot (no butter, sugar or sherry needed, just time), add 4-6C beef stock (what&apos;s the point of low-sodium if you&apos;re going to add salt?), and forget the grated four-cheeses (use the traditional slice of Gruyere, Emmental or, if all else fails, generic Swiss). For individual servings, dissolve a beef bouillon cube in 6oz of boiling water, add 4-6oz caramelized onions, heat in microwave, add toasted bread and a slice of cheese and finish under the broiler."
5,I made this for the 2nd time last night. It&apos;s so easy and elegant! This time I used the crockpot to caramelize 3-4lbs sweet onion with 1/2 cup butter and tsp sea salt for six hours (on high)....Then added 4 cups good rich beef stock thyme red table wine and black pepper. Cooked on low for another 6 hrs. Cooking down the onions first in the crock made this so buttery and delicious. Top with toasted baguette with melted swiss.
4,Hi - very very good and easy.
5,WOW! I carmelized my onions early this morning. (took about an hour). I wouldn&apos;t skip this step - IT IS what makes the soup. You just can&apos;t duplicate that flavor! Also do NOT skip the sherry! I used Swanson beef stock fresh thyme and a dried bay leaf. It is in the crock pot now and will be ready for when we come back from two junior high basketball games around 7 pm. Having it with hamburgers for dinner tonight. It is going to take ALL OF ME not to go in the kitchen to ladle a bowl in secret! WISH I had oven proof crocks that way I could broil the cheese on top of the soup.....but we will improvise and it will still be great! GREAT RECIPE!
5,Very tasty with or without rum. I recommend to warm you up on a chilly night!
5,This is a great basic recipe. I added black beans & a couple shakes of Tobasco. It was awesome!
5,I doubled the recipe and used already roasted chicken breast. It’s delicious and very easy to make!
5,This was a very simple quick recipe with a boatload of flavor. Was a hit in my house. Beans ( black and pinto) make it extra hearty.
5,I broke with tradition and substituted cauliflower for the potatoes which also imparted a nice creamy texture to the soup. My family honestly could not tell the difference and the transformed recipe was more in compliance with the diet we re on! Tasted wonderful.
5,My only change was to add some garlic with the onions. My wife and I both enjoyed it.
5,"I’m one who never follows a recipe.  I did everything it asked me to but, had to add pepper, and ground cumin.  This was Very good. Looking for leftovers.  Next time I would add a can of Rotel.  Just for tomatoes and a little kick, and maybe some dice carrots and peas.  I would definitely make again as is but with a few added things."
5,This soup turned out great! That being said I made several changes. I recommend cooking the sausage with garlic as well as onion. I didn&apos;t mash the potatoes and because the soup was so thick I added some water to the broth to stretch it out. I added pepper and cayenne to taste. The sausage can be cooked while you wait for the potatoes to boil to save time.
5,Wife and I loved it we used chorizo sausage and kale in ours and it turned out great. Needed to add in a little olive oil for sauteing the onions after the sausage was browned as the chorizo didn&apos;t render much fat. Also added Garlic to ours. Sauteed several cloves of garlic (thinly sliced) in the sausage fat and olive oil before the onion cooked through. Be careful you don&apos;t add the garlic too soon though as the onion will take longer to cook than the garlic. We also subbed in red potatoes rather than the russets that Chef John used.
5,"Delicious Used ""regular""kale instead of dinosaur kale the second time we made this soup and it was just as delicious. We used hot italian sausage and it works too."
5,Great. Even better with a little hot sauce.. Of course i am from the south. Ha
5,addition of a small amount of chopped carrots. Loved the video presentation:)
5,I made this using a 1 pound head of cauliflower and 2 pounds of potatoes since I had that. I actually found the correct sausage but I ended up putting in the whole package (1 pound). Did everything as directed but when I started stirring in the kale I only used a pound. 2 pounds just seemed like too much! It was full of kale and it was a wonderful soup! Definitely a keeper. Husband and son didn t notice the cauliflower and I ll never tell.
2,"It&apos;s more like ""Soggy Mashed Potatoes with Kale"" than a soup both in texture and consistency. Even with only about 3/4Lb Kale and 1/4Lb Spinach it was extremely thick. My husband preferred to not eat on his lunch break when he came home to this. Very disappointing for us as devout Chef John followers. I basically refuse to waste food so to salvage it I&apos;ve been putting about 3c at a time into a medium Pyrex pan covering with 1/2c enriched white rice and 1c water or 1 small packet of Saffron Rice Mix and 1c water. I bake it for like an hour( ) at 350 stirring occasionally to turn the already thick nature into a casserole."
5,"This was delicious!  The only thing I did different was I added a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce.  Very, very good.  If you like it spicy you could add some hot sauce or a little chili powder.  I&apos;ve turned the AC down so I can pretend it&apos;s cold outside.  This soup is perfect for that...and healthy too.  PS.  I cooked it on the stove for 45 minutes instead of using the crock pot.  I was hungry."
4,"Great recipe. I added hamhocks, and added extra water from the start. I also added a half cup extra lentils and used stewed tomatoes. Whole family loved it including kids 5 and 7."
4,"This soup was thick and hearty.  I really enjoyed the flavor.  You may need to add a little more water, as mine turned out a little too thick.  A really enjoyable meal on a cold day with warm corn bread."
5,I have made this several times because my family enjoys it so much - even my son who is not a soup guy!  To make it easier and faster - I use the frozen chopped onions and the individual ham steak which I chop the night before.  I use 16 oz of lentils and add 2 more cups of water and 3-4 chicken boullion cubes.  Coming home from work to this dinner is so great on a cild winter night.  I serve it with fresh Italian bread and some sliced fresh mozzarella.
4,"This is a recipe worth keeping, but the cooking time seemed long to me. Lentils using take 20 to 30 minutes to cook in boiling water, so 11 hours seemed way off. And, so it is. After 11 hours the top of my stew was very dark and moisture in the slow cooker was almost nil. I added 2 cups of chicken broth to bring the stew back. It was eatable, but next time I am limiting cooking time to 3 to 4 hours on low. Fully cooked ham, veggies and lentils don&apos;t need half a day to cook. I would have rated the recipe 5 stars if not for the cooking time shown."
4,"I used A LOT of lentils, which was not a bad thing, but it was really, really thick and needless to say, I had to add more broth. No matter, it was fabulous! I had a ham bone in the freezer from a couple of months ago which was just waiting for this meal occasion. It gave the soup an incredible flavor. I bought a small turkey ham and chopped it up to add to the mix. I grew up always adding vinegar to my soup bowl, so I threw that in too. Man was this ever good on this very cold N.J. March evening. Thanks so much ""Queendiva1""; we loved it!"
5,Really good. It takes eleven hours so instead of starting it in the morning I started it the night before and let it cook all night. Then I just reheated it later that night to eat. I did add a little salt.
5,"Mmmmm, this soup is so simple and satisfying. I originally tried this recipe to get rid of left-over ham, but now I am making it all the time! It is so healthy, extremely inexpensive to make, and the leftovers are very good."
5,This is probably my favorite recipe for soup on this site. No changes except for cooking time. I cook on high for about 4 hrs. and it always comes out perfect.
3,This was a good start to lentil soup recipe but needs something much more. My husband loves soups but didn&apos;t even get 25% ate. He pushed it aside and said it lacked flavor. Kids didn&apos;t eat much either. I will be back on the hunt for a new lentil soup recipe
5,I am a soup lover. I wanted to make avacado soup and thought I would give this one a try.  Wow!  I didn&apos;t use as many jalapeno&apos;s as called for and removed the seeds.  Glad I did.  Three peppers were just about right for us.  This is the perfect soup to accompany your Mexican Food dinner. We had a good Mexican beer with our meal and it was perfect.
5,"so tasty! i&apos;ve made this soup many times, i add corn and sometimes a little rice too"
5,"This was fantastic!!  I loved the lime juice in this soup- it gave it a nice tang.  It was very filling, but light so you can have it any day of the week.  I actually wish it had more avocado so I added 2 instead of 1 1/2.  I also added a dollop of sour cream at the end and it gave the soup a nice rich flavor.  Will definetly make this again."
3,I hate to be the lone disenting voice but we ended up throwing most of this out. I highly suggest you add the lime a little bit at a time to taste. It was just waaay too sour and tangy for us. I took some of the leftovers and poured off most of the tangy broth and replaced it with plain chicken broth. I then topped it with shredded Monterey Jack and some thin crushed tortilla chips. It was much improved but still probably not a soup I would make again. Sorry.
5,"I fell in love with chicken and lime soup while traveling in the Yucatan years ago.  When I found this recipe, I fell in love all over again. This has become a staple for me, and I have developed a few variations- first, I usually double the avocado and tomato for a heartier soup; sometimes I add sour cream.  For a vegetarian version I eliminate the chicken and substitute vegetable broth, and add ground cumin, corn and black beans (canned works fine, one can each, rinsed and drained). The soup is beautiful and spicy, perfect for a light summer meal with fresh garden tomatoes, or as a colorful and spicy winter treat."
5,very tastey! I made quite a bit to feed my mom my sister and some hungry men and it satisfied all! My sister doesn&apos;t like cilantro and my dad doesn&apos;t like avocado so rather than add them to the soup i added them to individual bowls and everyone could have as much as they liked of each. I wasn&apos;t going to toast the tortilla strips &apos;cause i figured they&apos;d just get soggy anyway (so what&apos;s the point?) But since i was preheating the oven for something else i did it anyway. I&apos;m glad i did because the next day i just threw some torilla strips in with the left overs and they were a whole different kind of soggy! tortilla mush. Definately toast them first.:) I also added corn for a little more color and a tad less garlic. I threw in some more spices toward the end for more flavor to make up for slightly less jalapeno. (I didn&apos;t want to kill everyone with the ammount called for in this recipe!) It could have used more chicken for our tastes as well but totally a keeper. Very easy to modify! The lime was excellent i could have used more. I served this with cuban black beans best spanish rice and ultimate frozen strawberry margaritas. What a hit!
5,I added a can of pinquito beans and some frozen corn to this recipe and it was very filling and flavorful. The cilantro and real lime juice really make it stand out. Very good.
5,This soup has great flavor. Husband loves it tremendously. He suggests a side dish of Mexican rice & beans. A definite recipe to make over and over. Thanks!!
5,LOVE this recipe!!! Will make again and again. My boyfriend is a big soup person and loved it. Definately one of the best soup recipes i&apos;ve ever made...thanks for sharing it!!
5,one of the best foods I have ever had I will eat it over and over
5,Delicious! So easy to make and much tastier than the ones I&apos;ve eaten in restaurants. Will be making this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.
5,simple and delicious
4,"Miso is fermented. When it is boiled, or poured into boiling water, the live, active cultures are killed. Take the soup off the heat and let it stop boiling before adding the miso."
1,es we11!
5,"I have not had pasta fazool for ages, because it usually makes so much.  This is perfect for a retired couple.  I also added some crushed rosemary and boiled some ditalini noodles separately, a salad and some Italian bread.  The Swiss Chard. if you can find it in your store, is a nice change from spinach.  Thank You again Chef John."
3,I followed this recipe as written with one exception and that was replacing the Swiss chard with fresh spinach. I was intrigued with adding the dry pasta to the sausage mixture which is why I decided to give this a try. Unfortunately it didn t work well for me. I was concerned the pasta would absorb a lot of the broth but I forged ahead anyway. I put this together just a few hours ahead and by the time I re-heated it yep nearly all the broth had been absorbed by the pasta. I had used a full four cups of broth but ended up adding another full 14.5 oz. can while re-heating. The taste was ok but I preferred it the next day as the flavors had had more time to develop. My version yielded 4 large portions not 2. If I make this again I ll cook the pasta separately and add it when re-heating.
5,"No changes this time. I might use smaller elbow mac next time. I didn&apos;t realize I grabbed big ones. This the first time my hubs used  bread to sop up the broth. Oh, and I used Rancho Gordo beans...if you&apos;re going to eat beans, eat the best. :)"
5,"Add this to your favorites first thing. I used baby Bok Choy because they didn&apos;t have Swiss Chard. It still was still good but probably better if you used the right ingredients which is why I rated it 5 stars, not based on my subpar add ins. I like the video because he explained why you need to do certain things so it doesn&apos;t appear as a mistake, like cooking the pasta with the sausage. Which is a must. I had bought Panera&apos;s small sourdough bread bowls and made a quick salad. A very tasty and filling meal on a cool Autumn evening. You won&apos;t be disappointed. I also added a little Chèvre on top so it doesn&apos;t give you that bloated feeling. Seems to really work..."
3,"First time ever making soup...think I overdid it with the Sausage.  Instead of using two links, I used four.  My family said it wasn&apos;t salty, but I had to use extra broth and water to off-set the Sausage because I thought it would be too salty.  I overcooked the elbow noodles so they were pretty mushy by the time I served the dish.   I also used spinach instead of what was recommended.  I think next time I stick with the recipe exactly as written.  One thing I highly recommend to people like me who are just starting to cook, prepare veggies and things that go into the soup ahead of time before combining them.  I threw the sausage into the oil like the recipe called, but I had to ask my Son-in-Law to cut the onion and celery because I was too busy breaking up the sausage in the pan.  As time goes on I&apos;ll get better in my preparation.  This was a ""live and learn"" experiment."
5,"I made this soup exactly as writtten this evening and served it to my husband,  who could not believe that it took so little time to produce something so DELICIOUS.  
                                
                                Many thanks to Chef John for making me look like I know what I&apos;m doing in the kitchen!"
5,Could eat this once a week.  Yummy
5,I made it straight the first time and the second time substituted kale for chard and leeks for the onion. Even better! This is a super yummy soup I fantasize ahead about eating!
5,"Delicious! I made exactly as directed, except that I doubled it (we are in for several days of cold and rainy weather). As always, I highly recommend watching Chef John’s video, he cracks me up plus you get a little more information on how or why he recommends doing something a certain way (like why to add uncooked mac instead of cooking it first). So, make this recipe and enjoy a hug from an Italian grandmother. UPDATE: I made this 3 months ago and had a good 2 full servings leftover that I put in Tupperware and threw in the freezer. Yesterday, I set it in the fridge to defrost for 24 hours. Tonight, I put it in a saucepan with 1/2 a cup of chicken broth for 15-20 min and it was awesome! So just wanted to add a comment that is freezes very well!"
5,I loved this recipe but I made a few changes that made it more healthy.  I used 5 cupes of chicken broth instead of the 3 and substituted 2 cups of skimmed milk for the 2 cups of heavy cream.  It came out very creamy and extremely tasty.  It was a smash with my husband. This recipe is definitely a keeper!
4,"I tryed using puree potatoes instead of cream, cup for cup.  Instead of having a fatting soup I felt guilty about later, I had one that everyone including my lactose intolorent grandmother loved."
5,"This is a really nice soup!  I made a few changes, but the underlying idea was the same.  I only had one head of cauliflower and had to use onion instead of shallots because my store didn&apos;t have shallots.  I also used an entire bulb of garlic.  I subbed 1% milk for cream to lighten it up and added a dash of crushed red pepper and a handful of shredded cheddar (i forgot to adjust the milk for less cauli and needed to thicken it up a bit).  This is not the most visually appealing soup, but it tastes GREAT!  I will reduce the thyme a little next time per personal preference."
4,"I made this soup after I read many reviews.  I used 1 head of cauliflower, added 2 potatoes and 2 large carrots, added 7 large cloves of garlic and 3 shallots tossed them all in 1/4 cup EVO, layered on a roasting pan then sprinkled with ground pepper and sea salt and roasted. I upped the chicken stock to 4 and left out the water. I also added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream. After I blended everything with a hand immersion blender I added 1/2 cup of both freshly grated Asiago & 1/2 cup of Old Cheddar and salt and pepper to taste.  Amazing.  Garnished it with fresh bacon bits, fresh chives a few pieces of roasted Cauliflower florets and a little of the grated cheese blend. and served it home made buttermilk biscuits (recipe from Allrecipes)  Great for this cold rainy fall day."
5,This was exceptional! I used potatoes in it as another reviewer had suggested and added a small amount of cream at the end. Delicious.
5,I have made this a couple of times now b/c my BF has declared it his favourite soup (and I make A LOT of soup). Both times I only used one head of cauliflower and added some combination of carrots turnips and potatoes - which is nice b/c then I can use up whatever is in the fridge. Both times I did add 4 cups of broth (no water) and no heavy cream milk or any other substitute. The soup is already thick and rich enough in my opinion.
5,My wife and I loved this soup. I used half-and-half and reduced the roasting time to about 20 mins. (I made half the recipe). I also added a little more broth than the recipe called for to get the consistency right. It was absolutely delicious.
5,This was fantastic. Also added 2 fresh carrots sliced to the roasting pan. (and a few extra cloves of garlic and 1 more shallot)Make sure the cauliflower is nicely browned before blending. Loved it.
4,Great flavor but be careful not to burn the cauliflower. Had to start all over again but it was worth it!
3,This was OK. I love soups but it just didn&apos;t do it for me. I noticed (after making it) that several of the reviewers who raved about it added other things (like carrots). Maybe that&apos;s the trick to making it better. I think I&apos;ll just stick to straight up roasted cauliflower and make soups out of other things.
5,"I hate when people alter the recipe and then rate the recipe based on the changes they made.  I believe rating should be on the recipe as it is written.  That being said, we&apos;re giving this one 5 stars.  I can see how some of the suggested additions/adjustments could be good as well, but the recipe is wonderful as is.  The aroma, flavor and texture were all good enough that I could see this soup served at a fine restaurant.  The ingredients all worked together very well and there wasn&apos;t anything that seemed out of place.  I was worried about the dill and thought it would overpower but it definitely does not.  
                                
                                I can see how some people might find this soup to be a little on the heavy side (with the half-and-half and the butter) or salty side (with the use of regular chicken broth), but personally I don&apos;t think anything needs to be done.  I think it&apos;s a good fall soup worth trying."
5,"Wonderful soup and perfect for a cold snowy day!  Made exactly as written and received great reviews from those heading in from the slopes.  Based on personal preference, I reduced the butter down to 2.5 tablespoons of butter - couldn&apos;t tell the difference.  Will definitely go into my family&apos;s list of favorites!!!"
5,"My grandfather grew up in Poland near the Russian border and this potato soup reminds me of our family recipe.  This soup is comforting, rich, delicious, and not your ordinary potato soup but out of this world!  I substituted onions for leeks, and added 1/2 cup sour creme in addition to half and half.  I used portabella mushrooms rather than button mushrooms for richer flavor.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
5,"I reviewed this a while back.  Had to update the process I intend to use from now on.  I found that the cream and flour mixture to thicken the soup wasn&apos;t necessary IF you blend at least half the soup before adding the mushrooms.  The blended potato made it chowder-like.  I also added a dollop of sour cream for a nice tart flavor, and shredded cheese on top.  LOVE IT!"
5,Holy toledo this was amazing soup! I substituted sour cream for the half n half like a previous reviewer suggested. Wow! The dill really added a special and yummy twist. Loved it and will definately make it again!
5,This soup was fabulous! The broth was so good! I used a sweet onion instead of leeks and I sauteed the potatoes and onion together before putting it into the soup and then sauteed the carrots. I just cut my mushrooms and put them straight into the soup. I can&apos;t wait to make it again.
5,This is so good. I used onions instead of leeks and added a little crumbled bacon when served. Delicious. thank you DTERESA.
5,"This is absolutely fabulous!  It&apos;s a cross between mushroom soup, and potatoe soup -- and the best of both!  Everyone LOVES this!  It&apos;s even great the next day!!  FABULOUS flavor!  YUM!"
5,Mmmmm....wonderful....I substituted the half and half for plain yogurt mixed with a bit of water and also whole wheat flour works well....I also pureed half the veggies in my blender at the end of the recipe and mixed it back into the soup for a more creamy texture....fabulous! Thank you!
3,Not bad but not totally to our taste. Still it&apos;s easy and fast to make.
5,"This is beyond awesome. I didn&apos;t have clam juice as Cindy recommended to cook the potatoes in, but I did have chicken broth. I had about four large celery ribs that needed to be used, so I just chopped it up along with the carrots and threw them in the bacon fat with the potatoes. (I had to add just a little more previously reserved bacon fat to the pan, only because there was more veg. I know I&apos;m not the only one who saves bacon fat in the fridge!) I followed the recipe exact. I&apos;m the only one who loves clam chowder in this house, which is fine with me. I&apos;m NOT SHARING. I ate two bowls with homemade ranch oyster crackers. I feel better already! NOTE: Next time, I&apos;ll be sure to cook the potatoes with the clam juice. Good tip."
5,"Yummm, I love this!  Instead of cooking the potatoes in the water I use 2 bottles of clam juice.  Makes it more clammy.  I had submitted this about 7 years ago and I&apos;ve changed it a bit since then.  Still using the Knoor Brand Leek Soup mix."
5,"I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  Here&apos;s why:  First, it&apos;s SUPER easy to put together.  Second, it&apos;s MUCH less expensive than buying the *gasp!* canned stuff.  And third, EVEN I LIKED IT!!  I should mention that I really don&apos;t like clam chowder at all, but of course the only stuff I&apos;ve ever tasted was the canned stuff *gasp again!*  My kids love clam chowder and fight each other for it if there&apos;s not enough to share, so I made this for them.  As recommended, I used two bottles of clam juice instead of water to boil the potatoes and carrots in.  I had promised the recipe&apos;s author on the Recipe Exchange that I would at least TASTE the soup and boy am I glad I did!!  The kids almost had to fight ME for this.  We&apos;ll definitely be having this soup again many, many times.  Thanks for making me a clam chowder lover, Cindy!!"
5,I Love this recipe but I hate when people make changes to it then Post that. If you have ideas why don&apos;t you create your own recipe and post that. Don&apos;t screw with someone else&apos;s creation. How rude
5,"I will elaborate, but I think Hubs&apos; remark as he ate his first spoonful says it all.  ""This is really good,"" he said.  ""Much better than most of the stuff I get at restaurants.  Make it again.""  How&apos;s THAT for a compliment?  I stuck pretty closely to the recipe, but I did substitute celery for the carrots (icky-I don&apos;t like them), and added some finely chopped onion.  I also covered the potatoes with bottled clam juice (one 8-0z bottle for a half recipe)  rather than water, which I think contributed significantly to its full flavor.  I did find then, that I didn&apos;t need quite the full amount of half-and-half to achieve the right level of thickness.  I didn&apos;t add salt to the soup, thinking there might just be enough in the leek soup mix, which proved to be the case.  This is rich, full-flavored and satisfying in every way. We cleaned up every drop."
5,"This chowder definitely lives up to it&apos;s name! It is not too milky, or too clammy, it&apos;s just right! Very hearty and easy soup to make. I used chicken broth in place of water to cover my potatoes, may try using extra clam juice next time. I also added in an onion with the potato and carrot, just because I had one and I felt like it should be in there . I did only use one package of the leek soup mix merely because I am a dork and only grabbed one at the store. I think one did the soup just fine though : )  Served it up in some sourdough breadbowls (wish I could have made those too!) and it was to die for! My man couldn&apos;t stop saying how good it was, best we&apos;ve ever had. Thanks for the awesome recipe Cindy!"
5,This is a savoury chowder. I followed the directions exactly as written by Cindy. (I did buy minced clams by mistake but I actually like the smaller pieces).Even if you do not like clam chowder I think you would like this one it does not taste clamy at all. I made it in the morning planning on reheating it for dinner in a double boiler but it was so flavoursome I ended up eating a bowl for breakfast. Served with oyster crackers one night and Cheddar Bay Biscuits the next night. Will with out a doubt be making this all winter long. Awesome recipe Cindy thank you
5,Very easy and very tasty! I followed the recipe as written using fat free half and half. I did add about a teaspoon of thyme because I think it adds a richness to the clam flavor. I served this with homemade Caraway Rye from this site and a green salad. Turned a gloomy wet day right around. Thanks Cindy this is a keeper.
5,This totally lived up to its name. It was AWESOME and so easy to make. Followd recipe exactly but husband allergic to half and half so used milk instead
1,Where was the clam taste???? The soup was decent for a cream of potato soup but I have another great recipe for that! Very disappointing. I followed the exact recipe and thought I must have done something wrong but I didn&apos;t...
5,"Great recipe. A bit time consuming because of making the shredded chicken but so delicious I&apos;ve made it a few times now (and I&apos;m very picky about recipes when they take over 45 minutes to make). Achiote powder was hard to find. You might look for it under Annatto seed instead if you can&apos;t find it (it&apos;s a bright red powder). This flavor is what really makes this dish, in my opinion."
5,I used oyster ear mushrooms and turmeric (it was all I had) and added shredded cabbage to the boil (for the fiber;) ). I dipped a warm hard roll in it added a light salad and some iced tea. More than a meal. I thought it was an excellent recipe and far better even than I expected.
4,This had a wonderful flavor. I couldnt find achiote powder so i used achiote paste and it didnt desolve well but it was still very tasty. I think next time ill add a bit more broth because i like it a little more soupy. Im half filipino so this was a comforting and nostalgic dish.
5,Despite the extra preparations needed it was well worth the trouble for a really good Pinoy comfort food. I didn&apos;t have the achiote powder but it was not missed. Thank you for another wonderful recipe Lola!
5,Ginger is a must add! My grandma does it that way too and it adds a whole other level of flavor. This is my comfort food go to.
5,This was comfort food to me...similar to my Mom&apos;s. The older I get the more I want to learn Filipino recipes for my daughter to eat since she is mestiza. A little time consuming but worth it... I couldn&apos;t find the achiote powder but I found the seed so I crushed it to powder (be careful it may stain). I will have to try it with cabbage and carrots next time. I like my veggies. Also my mom adds ginger to her recipe. Super tasty!
5,Incredible. The best ever. I have a chineese exchange student and she raved about it.
4,"Most of the work of course is boiling the chickenand shredding. Otherwise it&apos;s really good and easy. Next time I""ll turn off the pot a little earlier as the noodles became soft later. Definitely add ginger to make it like Moms."
5,This is a great recipe for leftover chicken.  Absolutely loved the way it tasted.
5,Brilliant recipe. Efcharisto for sharing it. This is really good and honest kitchen.
5,This was very good! The lemon really lightens up the soup. The only thing I did different was instead of discarding the veggies I used a stick blender and just pureed them into the broth. I might also try adding a bit of lemon zest next time to enhance the lemon flavor. Nice change from my regular chicken soup will definitely make again.
5,Thanks for this exquisite recipe! I as did one other reviewer blended the vegetables into the soup for added flavor and nutrition. I think that I will add in lemon zest as well next time too to enhance the very lemony flavor which I love.
5,I cooked this for the very first time for our very Greek Easter and very Greek family members. It was Amazing!!!! Will be making it again.
5,Beautiful soup! Filling and delicious. I used my home-made chicken stock instead of the whole chicken then added some chicken breasts which I shredded. Also good without the extra chicken meat. Elegant and simple like most things that impress.
1,I don&apos;t know if I did something wrong when adding the eggs but it was blah! My husband refused to eat it.
5,Wonderful flavor - a real keeper. Thanks so much for sharing!
4,Very good. I added extra lemon juice to my bowl. I also took the other&apos;s advice and added the veggies after sticking them in the blender but I just added a few spoonfuls to my own bowl. Seems like maybe some herbs could be added. Not sure what to add but it is kind of a mild soup. Very good though and I got seconds!
3,Good starting point. I wanted to recreate a soup that is served at a local restaurant. This soup was a bit thinner the egg flavor was less strong and the lemon was more of a sour flavor - as opposed to a bright flavor (holla if you hear me!). I like a strong chicken flavor but did not want to mess with all the skimming so I used 2 lbs split bone-in chicken breast and replaced the water with chicken stock. Hubby hates veggies so I removed them as the recipe suggests but if I had my druthers I&apos;d chop them up leave them in and reduce the amount of chicken. PS... be sure to FOLD the yolks into the egg whites (rather than beat in the mixer) or it will be frothy. Despite the differences the whole family enjoyed the soup.
5,"I have been making this recipe for about 4 years now and consider it the best version of wedding soup I have ever tasted. I make a double batch of meatballs from ground sirloin, then bake them at 350 for about 12-15 minutes to get rid of the grease. I then freeze half of them for another day. Definitely use the fresh basil and onion in the meatballs, and the lemon zest in the soup. They are what set this recipe apart from the usual salty wedding soups. It also helps to use homemade or organic chicken broth."
4,This is good but I tried it the 2nd time with just pork meatballs and it is much tastier. Chicken and pork mixed is also tastier than the ground beef.
5,Wow! I have never rated a recipe before but I randomly came across this one and thought the ingredients sounded good. While it was cooking my husband turned up his nose and questioned where I got the idea from. When I served it he coldn&apos;t stop raving and not a drop was left. It is luscious delectable and definitely one our new comfort foods! Don&apos;t hesitate make it today. I would have given it six stars if it had been an option! (PS I used the spinach instead of the escarole and we served it with a generous splash of lemon juice on each bowl)
5,This is a light soup that is perfect with deli sandwiches for a quick and easy summer meal. I used ground turkey in place of ground beef and added the juice of half a lemon to the pot. As others suggested I made the meatballs as small as possible and used spinach. Even my fussy teen-aged daughter loved it. This is a great soup to serve when you want to impress someone--it looks like a lot more work would have gone into preparing it but it&apos;s really simple and easy to make.
5,"Wonderful soup - the lemon zest is mandatory! I used all the fresh herbs as recommended, plus  added more chopped green onions into the soup itself. Used fresh Italian sausage for great flavor; no escarole available so had to use spinach; added 1 med cubed red potato  (skin on) + 1/2 cup shredded carrots, then since it was a touch salty (may replace some broth with water next time), I added 1/2 cup milk and my family raved about it and a couple asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!"
5,I have been making Italian wedding soup for years and everyone loves it yes it is so easy to make but the whole idea of flavoring the chicken broth is to cook the meatballs directly in the broth being as tiny as they are they cook very quickly. I use lemon pepper if I don&apos;t have lomon it helps brighten up the taste.
4,This is a great recipe however I changed it slightly by using half lean pork meat and half lean ground beef and the flavour was immensly better.
5,"DELICIOUS! Fresh herbs are a must to give this such flavor. My meatballs were 1/2"" and I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes to release the grease. I like this recipe for the ease of making it in such a short time. The only thing missing was those toasted cheddar bread cubes. Will make again!"
5,This soup was excellent! I&apos;ve never had Italian Wedding Soup anywhere but Atlanta Bread Co. so I was excited to see this recipe. It was extremely easy to make - the only time consuming part being rolling the meatballs. As per other&apos;s suggestions I also recommend making the meatballs as small as you can roll them and have them stay together. This recipe served 4 without ANY left-overs so adjust accordingly.
3,Not bad but I have had better Wedding soup. The search continues. The meatballs are terrific. that is why I gave it threee stars.
5,"I would recommend NOT making alterations to this soup because the purpose of the set recipe is to lose weight.  I did lose weight when I made this (it was for a vacation), and it tasted great!!  I checked with a local hospital, and they said this recipe is used for overweight patients to get them to lose weight rapidly to prepare for surgery.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone!"
5,"I&apos;ve been making this for my boyfriend for about three months now.  The only thing I do different is to add ground turkey.  He eats a light breakfast of whatever he wants, a light sandwich for lunch and the soup for dinner.  He likes to add some heat in the form of Tabasco or different dried peppers as it heats on the stove EVERY NIGHT.  He&apos;s lost over 50 pounds!  I&apos;m sick of making it, but if it&apos;s working and he&apos;s enjoying it, I&apos;ll keep a pot of it in the fridge."
5,"First of all, a minor caveat-- I&apos;ve never had to diet, since I have a pretty fast metabolism, so I can&apos;t really compare this to other diets. BUT... Several years ago, I started a new job and found myself sending out for fast food for lunch every day, eating it at my desk. All of a sudden, my clothes started to... *shrink*. I stepped on the scxale and saw that I&apos;d gained 15 pounds!!! I panicked!
                                
                                Found this ""diet"" and decided to try it. The weight just went away! It does get a little boring... But it&apos;s tasty and painless; think about adding different spices and/or herbs to the soup to vary it... chili powder, curry, etc. Now, I *did* have to change the way I had lunch once I lost the weight... No more fast food breakfasts and lunches (except for the occasional emergency...), trying to get out and walk a bit a few times a week at lunch... But it did get the weight off and-- with my revamped lunch hour-- kept it off."
4,"This is a very good for you and tasty soup, however, when I used to make this some time ago, I also thought that it lacked something or needed a little more flavor.  To give it the flavor it needs, I decided an old trick my grandmother use to use in her vegetable soup.....add a jar or can of sauerkraut in place of some of the cabbage and it gives it just the zing it needs.  Other than that, I left the recipe pretty much as is, I just didn&apos;t do a whole lot of measuring, just threw it all together and let it cook.  Enjoy!"
5,"I ate this soup for months when the recipe came out years ago.  You have to eat nothing else to lose weight....and I did, about 30 lbs.!!  I gave the recipe to everyone at work and they all lost weight too.  Besides which, it is an excellent soup (not so much for breakfast as we did back then!) but I still like it.  I have added chick peas to the recipe for some protein.  Also some lean hamburger goes well.  Thanks for the memories!"
5,"I make this when I&apos;m looking to lose weight quickly. I tried to follow the recipe as close as I could, adding minced garlic and omitting the canned green beans, but adding more celery and carrot. (Ew. Am I the only person who can&apos;t stand canned green beans?) I also added basil, oregano, thyme and a couple bay leaves. It dosen&apos;t affect the fat burning process to add a little flavor, does it? ;) I used my biggest stock pot and it came right up to the edge. So, plan accordingly. TIP: Make sure you are close to a bathroom about an hour or so after you eat this. This cleans out your system VERY well. EDITED: One pot of this soup lasted me one week, eating it three meals a day. To make it more filling, I add just a little cubed chicken breast. Just in a week, I can feel my pants getting looser. Good stuff. ANOTHER TWO WEEKS LATER: Down ten pounds!"
5,"Very good.  I used my food processor for most of the chopping, adjusted the seasonings to my personal taste, and simmered for a couple of hours.  I froze individual servings and have been bringing it to work for lunch.  It&apos;s very filling.  The only thing I would/will do differently next time is transfer some of the soup to a blender and process until smooth, then add back into the soup for a creamier texture."
3,"The amount of cabbage in this recipe is overpowering. I like cabbage, but this is too much!  If I make this again I will likely only use 1/4 the amount of cabbage and add other healthy veggies like squash and zucchini to make up for it.  I will also cut the recipe in half as it does cook entirely too much... 
                                
                                The thing that makes this soup a ""fat burner"" is you can eat ten bowls in one day and still be below 1000 calories. The carbs are low and there is no fat. If you make variations that don&apos;t include fat, carbs, and calories than you should still have the ""fat burning"" effect of this soup."
5,"LOVE IT!! ADDED FEW SHAKES OF TEXAS PETE HOT SAUCE AND WORCESTERSHIRE AND LEMON-PEPPER SEASONING.  FOR A BURST OF FLAVOR & STILL HEALTHY ADD 1/2LB OF FROZEN,PLAIN (NOT BREADED)OKRA.  ALSO, I DIDN&apos;T COOK THE SOUP TOO LONG...THE VEGGIES WERE STILL AL DENTE AND SLIGHTLY CRUNCHY...SO DELICIOUS.  NO TROUBLE GETTING YOU DAILY QUOTA OF VEGGIES WITH THIS RECIPE...I COULD EAT IT ALMOST EVERY DAY.  OH, DON&apos;T CUT YOUR ONIONS & CARROTS TOO SMALL CAUSE CHUNKIER IS BETTER IN THIS ONE."
5,"SUPERB beef stew!  I took the great base recipe, and tweaked it with a compilation of reviewer recommendations.  The end result is a winner, to be sure.  Here is what I did (and I won&apos;t change a thing the next time I make it): 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt.  Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag.  Shake beef in bag to coat.  Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned.  Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften.  Transfer to slow cooker.  2.  Mix beef broth (I used Swanson&apos;s Certified Organic in aseptic carton) with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine.  Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker.  3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions:  increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick&apos;s Beef Stew Seasoning.  Your home will smell wonderful all day, and your meal will be a savory feast!  I served the stew in bowls, accompanied by slices of fresh, crusty bread."
5,"I have been making this stew for almost 3 years and wanted to review it again.  Although I&apos;m sure Corinne&apos;s suggestions are good, what I like most about this recipe is the simplicity of preparation...no browning the beef.  I&apos;ve made this over a couple dozen times at least - doubled - and have never had leftovers.  It is a terrific recipe as written."
5,"I made this stew for the first time using Corinne&apos;s suggestion.  The stew turned out great!  The next week, I made the stew following the exact recipe (minus the celery, since I didn&apos;t have any); and I must say that the stew turned out EVEN BETTER when following the exact recipe.  (Also, I didn&apos;t have as many dishes to wash.)  This stew is SO DELICIOUS.  Next time I make this you can bet I will follow the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN."
5,"I don&apos;t understand why Corrine doesn&apos;t just post her own recipe for beef stew.  The point is to review the given recipe, not list a million changes to it.  This stew is perfect AS WRITTEN.  If you make any changes, you are not making this recipe for beef stew!!!!"
5,"THIS is a terrific basic recipe!!  Nothing to stop you from adding your favorite things - although the TASTE is GREAT just like it is.  I used chuck because it&apos;s not as dry as a bottom round.  I had a tomato so I chopped it up & added it.  I saw where someone had added an envelope of beef gravy - great idea too!!!  Thank goodness there&apos;s people out there REALLY KNOW HOW TO COOK!!  Oh, and don&apos;t bother to brown the beef the way some recipes state - it only makes the beef dry.  Thanks for this recipe."
5,"An excellent and easy stew recipe. I make minimal changes (I like parsnips, so I add three chopped in place of celery, and I add a little more broth because I like more gravy), but that&apos;s about it. This is one of those easy, homey, stick-to-your-ribs recipes. Some of the reviews tick me off: Yes, it&apos;s a ""regular"" stew recipe because it is, after all, STEW. And all the changes that other reviewers make? Don&apos;t say ""I made this recipe, but I changed EVERYTHING about it."" You aren&apos;t doing this recipe justice.. heck, you aren&apos;t doing THIS recipe at all. I&apos;m as guilty of changing recipes to suit my tastes and pantry as much as anyone, but at least tell us that you&apos;ve made the original recipe as written before doing your million-and-one changes! Thanks for sharing this tasty-as-written recipe, Buchko!"
5,"I made similar adjustments to previous raters.  I dredged the beef in flour/salt/pepper and pan friend until browned in olive oil before adding to the slow cooker.  Then I added some butter and onion to the pan and cooked until softened. Next I deglazed the pan with some of the broth being sure to  scrape up the yummy bits. In total I used 2 10 oz cans of beef broth.  I added 10 oz. sliced button mushrooms. Used almost 2T worchestershire sauce, added a bunch of extra herbs and finally thickened with cornstarch.  It was perfect."
4,"I followed Corinnes suggestions and this came out fantastic! The flavor and cosistency were wonderful, and just as good the next day. 
                                So you dont have to search for it, here is her suggestion: 1. Increase flour to 1/3 cup and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt. Put flour mixture into gallon-sized, zippered bag. Shake beef in bag to coat. Sauté coated beef in 1-2 tablespoons olive oil until browned. Add chopped onion to beef to sauté and soften. Transfer to slow cooker. 2. Mix beef broth with 1 TABLEspoon Worcestershire and ½ cup red wine. Pour into hot skillet to deglaze, then pour over beef and onions in cooker. 3. Add remaining ingredients with these additions: increase garlic to 2 cloves minced, 2 bay leaves; add 1 packet McCormick&apos;s Beef Stew Seasoning."
5,"I have this exact recipe in the recipe booklet that came with my slow cooker! I make it all of the time and my family loves it. I use a packet of dry onion soup mix in place of all the spices, only because it&apos;s an easy and convenient way to toss it together."
3,This just tasted like regular old beef stew to me.  Nothing unusual or great about it.  My fiance said there was too much meat and not enough vegetables.  I&apos;ll keep searching for another recipes.  I think this would&apos;ve benefited from a 1/2 c. red wine.
3,"This has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup.  As is, it’s just o.k.   To me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce.  It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me."
3,"Three stars because it actually tasted good, but the whole cooking process was just strange. In all my years of cooking, I have never seen instructions like that. All you really gotta do is brown your butter, add the other veggies along with the broth, simmer til the vegetables are done. Then add your thickener - in this case, flour and melted butter. Then you add the milk and the cheese. It turned out great this way, and only took me and my daughter about a half hour to make it. Simmering the already thickened broth/milk for 20 minutes? Then adding the vegetables and cooking them for another 20 minutes? Seems to me that the recipe instructions are actually written in reverse!"
5,"I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn&apos;t have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle&apos;s sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera&apos;s.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!"
2,"I hate to leave a 2-star, unfavorable review.  However, to be fair to those who want to try this in the future, I want to give my opinion: it was bland and utterly tasteless. I was so disappointed that I didn&apos;t care how close it was to Panera&apos;s recipe -- I just wanted flavor!  I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too), and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner, and I will make this regularly throughout the winter, WITH my additions. Good luck!"
5,"The family loved this soup. The only changes I made was to thin the roux with chicken broth instead of milk and added the broth instead of milk. Then I added all the veggies and simmered it, then added the milk at the end. Wonderful soup!"
5,"I&apos;ve made this soup before using a different recipe, couldn&apos;t find the old recipe so I decided to give this a try. I used the exact measurements and ingredients listed except celery, the only other difference I made was instead of simmering the milk/flour/butter to thicken I used chicken broth as the liquid, let it simmer a little (around 7 minutes) added all my veggies and 1/2 cup of water (my burners are too strong and I feared all the liquid evaporating and becoming a pudding instead of a soup) and let it simmer until veggies were tender. Last step I added milk, cheese and served. WOW. BIG HIT with me and my husband who doesn&apos;t like soup. The flavor was all there, just be careful with adding salt as most chicken stocks already have sodium and cheese adds a lot."
4,As the submitter said it&apos;s open to what you like to make your changes to fit your taste. I found two copycat Panera bread broccoli-cheese soup recipes - here & food.com. They are very very very similar. Food.com adds nutmeg. I like the almost invisible taste of nutmeg in creamy soups. I am not a nutmeg fan (always halve it in baked goods) but in this soup: Mmmm! I changed the directions because they seemed really odd/off the order of things. This one says 1 1/2c broccoli; the other 1/2#. &apos;Pretty sure the answer is in between those two. I went with close to 1/2#. Daughter said it had too much broccoli or not enough cheese - didn&apos;t know which.:) Anywayyyy I microsteamed it three minutes then allowed to cool. I sauteed 2 medium sized cut-bigger-than-matchstick carrots in 1/4c butter 5 minutes; then added 1 pc celery diced sauteed 2 minutes; then about half cup onion (half onion) five minutes. &apos;Meant to do the sprinkling of 1/4c flour next but got ancy & added 2c homemade chicken broth next. Put that in a blender (daughter request) along with the broccoli then back in the pot & thickened once it got hot. After thickening added 1/4t salt & nutmeg; & 1/8t black pepper; 1c 2% milk; 1c half&half.(Probably go for all half&half next time or more thickener with milk). I chopped up an 8oz block Kraft sharp cheddar but it wasn&apos;t sharp enough enough cheese or both. Simmered 15 minutes. Good soup.:)
3,"*arthur fist* Like many of the other reviewers, I had to tweak the recipe. The instructions didn’t read well to me so I took some suggestions and now I think I have a good system to get things the way I’d like.
                                
                                 I used 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar, 4 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of heavy cream, 1 cup of thin carrots, 4 table spoons of butter, ¼ cup of flour,  2 cloves minced garlic, ½ onion, salt, pepper, garlic powder, 1 tsp of nutmeg 10 oz of broccoli. Steam broccoli until soft and easy to cut (It took forever to get soft simmering with everything else) In another pot sautee onions, carrots (if you don’t have a blender I’d make the pieces even smaller) in butter until tender, then add flour and cook for a minute. Add 2 cups of broth to onions, carrots, and flour mixture. Add in your cup of heavy cream and bring to a boil then lower the temp, remove from heat and add cheese gradually while stirring (if you throw in all the cheese at once it&apos;ll get clumpy). Your mixture should be thick at this point, add the last 2 cups of broth to thin it out, and add in your broccoli. Add seasonings to taste. Let simmer for awhile and it should be good to go."
3,"I&apos;m rating it 3 because I have to rate it. But for a suggestion since I&apos;ve made the Panera copycat before. First is to blend the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a blender. Second, the secret ingredient is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product. And btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth."
5,Sounds like Brenda  is full of herself. Excellent recipe. It&apos;s five by itself. I&apos;m sure Brenda brought it down to three stars.
4,I did tweak this recipe and then it made it 5 stars!  I used more onion and more carrots.  I took some chicken stock and mixed it in with cream cheese to make it thick and creamy in place of using half and half.  I used seriously sharp cheddar cheese and super sharp cheddar cheese and when the soup was done I pureed part of it to make a thick and creamy soup.  This was an excellent soup with my changes!
5,"Made this recipe a few days ago, everyone in the family loved it so much. First time I made it I used frozen broccoli, which was great, but the second time tried it with fresh, steamed broccoli and it was even better. Can&apos;t recommend enough for a simple delicious meal. Thanks for sharing this recipe with our family!"
5,Delicious! Everyone loved it. Didn&apos;t change a thing. Good thing I doubled the recipe.
5,Better than any I&apos;ve ordered at a restaurant!!
5,I really enjoyed this recipe as did my husband.  The only change I made was to add some garlic with the onion.  The soup is really flavorful and is surprisingly filling.  I like that it can be made quickly with ingredients that are readily available all year long.
5,Wow just made this today! In love! I used vegetable broth as I am vegetarian and added some garlic cloves and cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit! So yummy!!!
5,"I thought this was delicious even before I put the cheese in. I should have read the cook&apos;s notes and made a lot more though. As written, we had two not quite full bowls and would be good for a side. But I WILL be making more because it was so good and easy. The only change I made was using veggie stock since we&apos;re vegetarians."
5,"Easy to make and tastes so delicious. I really appreciate that all of the ingredients are fresh. So many other recipes I read used canned soups (such as cream of chicken) or processed cheese. I read others reviews and, as one suggested, added a bit of garlic to the mix and I omitted the carrots and celery (because I don&apos;t like them in rich soups). I then doubled the recipe as the author mentioned. We loved it and are thrilled to have leftovers. This one is going to get used again and again."
3,Poor Brenda lol
5,"I halved this recipe but still kept the whole onion and peppers. I also couldn&apos;t find a red jalapeno, so used a green. The spice was just perfect for us and really had a great flavored soup base. Our guest don&apos;t eat spicy food at all and although they cleaned their bowls, they said it was a wee bit more spicy than they would make, but did like it. I didn&apos;t make the sour cream topping, since our guest don&apos;t really like cilantro, but it does sound good."
5,"My boyfriend raves about his ex girlfriends chili and I&apos;ve never made chili before. I had to search and search for the perfect recipe to show her up. Lol found this recipe and decided to try it. I couldn&apos;t find red peppers so I used 3 jalapeños. I added a can of rotel chipotle tomatoes. Everything else kept the same. Took to work for chili cook off and I got tons of compliments and was told several times, best chili they ever ate including my boyfriend!  Oh...and I won the contest. I make this often now.  Best chili ever!!!"
5,"Absolutely a great recipe. I could not find a red jalapeno pepper so I used two large red chili peppers. I increased the chili powder and cumin to 3 tablespoons each because I like mine a bit more spicy. I always use Conecuh Sausage in my chili recipes so I added 3/4 pound of that, fried and cut into small pieces. I did not have fire roasted tomatoes so I used 1 can of regular Rotel instead. I could not find a Anaheim pepper so I used a Poblano pepper instead. I cooked this in my Crock Pot for 6 hours. Other than these modifications I followed the recipe as written. I considered my personal recipe to be the best out there but this one beat me hands down. It will become my new recipe from now on. Simply a blue ribbon recipe for chili."
5,"I had to find a chili recipe for my office&apos;s chili cook off and found this recipe.  Read the reviews, especially about the one that claimed to have won their work&apos;s cook off and decided to make it.  Imagine my delight when I too won the chili cook off.  Everyone at the office raved about it.  It is hands down a winner and great tasting to boot.  I prepared all the ingredients and fried the meat and veggies the night before, placed all the ingredients in the crockpot and put it in the fridge overnight.  Cooked it over four hours on high in the crockpot the following day.  The chili was nice and thick and tasty, cooked to perfection.  Great choice."
4,"Really good recipe with good depth of flavor. Although it seemed to be missing that umami element that makes you go, ""oh my gosh!"" and I&apos;m entering it into a contest tomorrow being judged by some local celebrity chefs (I&apos;m in Nashville). 
                                
                                So I decided to take it in a bit of a Sante Fe direction and added diced Hatch green chilis and a 1.5 teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  Now I got the ""oh my gosh!""... I&apos;m also using Mexican crema blended with cumin and cilantro to drizzle across the top and I am deep frying thin slices of the Hatch chilis to garnish for texture.  I&apos;m competing against 10 others so we&apos;ll see how I do!
                                
                                UPDATE: I took first place! Thanks again for the recipe..."
5,My new go-to chili recipe. It is perfect.
1,"The tomato paste was ""way to much"", it over powers the other spices. My advice is to start with about 4,OZ and add to it if not delete it altogether."
5,"I am the primary cook in my house and cooking is kinda a hobby of mine. Needles to say my 8 kids eat well. I have been using a recipe that my mom used to make that I had tweaked over the years. But decided it was time to try something new as and found this highly rated recipe. 
                                
                                When I showed this to my wife for an ingredients run she thought I was nuts trying to make what sounds like a very spicy chili. Well I made a couple of minor mods and was very pleasantly surprised. My slightly modified version will be my new go to for chili. All of my kids liked it over grandma&apos;s recipe ad did all of my employees. 16 servings gone in the first 24 hours served and lots of compliments. No one complained that it was to spicy. 
                                
                                Made a 36 serving batch of this chili since I have so many  kids to feed and we like to freeze ready made meals. Since I have a variety of heat tolerances in my family I toned down the heat by only adding 1/2 of the chili powder  the recipe called for. Also omitted the tomato paste as there were several people who had gripped about it. I also added cubed steak, pork sausage and black beans. 
                                
                                Next time I&apos;ll make a bigger batch :)"
4,"Delicious.  Made exactly as directed (other than I only added 4 oz tomato paste)  To all the reviewers who modified the recipe  (other than the amount of tomato paste which must be a mistake), once you change the recipe, you are not reviewing this recipe  anymore, but your own modified take of it.  We want to know how this recipe is, not your version of it."
5,"This has to be one of the best tasting potato soup recipes I&apos;ve tried.  I think next time I will try adding some shredded cheese in the last step or stir some into a hot bowl of soup for an added kick.
                                
                                I did find that this recipe takes much longer to prepare than the recipe states.  The times listed in the preparation are assuming you&apos;re starting out with peeled/diced potatoes, chopped onions, chopped celery, etc.  If you have none of this prepared ahead of time (and who does?) then this recipe will take much longer to make.  Sure, it&apos;s worth the time it takes to make it...but don&apos;t use this recipe for as last-minute dinner when you&apos;re in a hurry or when you&apos;re really tired and just wanting a good soup.  It took me about two hours to make this from start to finish.
                                
                                The cooking of the potatoes in the middle of the recipe before the stock is added is an excellent step and it helps the potatoes cook much faster than they would have just by boiling alone.  The puree step at near the end is very important.  It highly affected the texture and flavor of the soup.  Don&apos;t skip that step!
                                
                                Also, please don&apos;t think that ""chicken broth"" and ""chicken stock"" are the same thing.  They&apos;re not!  I wasn&apos;t able to find chicken stock at Walmart, I had to go to Albertsons.  If you use chicken broth you&apos;ll get a much different result.
                                
                                I also noticed this recipe has no salt added.  I did find adding salt to my bowl of soup helped the flavor even more.  I suggest adding some salt!
                                
                                I hi"
4,"I read all the top reviews and nobody has mentioned this before so maybe it&apos;s not a big deal to some...but I thought the bacon would be SO much better if it wasn&apos;t boiled with the potatoes (after cooking it.)  It lost it&apos;s flavor and became soggy!  I think it would be so much better added at the end, after everything was pureed.  Just my $.02."
3,"Good base soup to build on for personal preference.  I felt the soup definitely lacked flavor, but wasn&apos;t sure if it was me, so I asked hubby to taste it.  Immediate response; ""terrible""!  Thought he was kidding me, but alas, he was not....   Back to the stove top it went; added chicken boullion to give the soup more complexity and depth, extra garlic, white pepper (better with cream bases than black pepper), leeks, celery, garlic salt, tsp of hot pepper sauce, dried parsley and a tad bit more tarragon.  Didn&apos;t need to puree the soup as the potatoes melted away.  Ultimate potato soup with additions!"
5,"I am a professional Chef and I teach Culinary classes, we used this recipe last night and it was given a thumbs up.  kudos to Karena"
5,"Thank you so much for letting us enjoy this wonderful soup. It was one of the last things my Father tasted before he died of lung cancer. It was amazing how much he ate of this soup even though he had a hard time getting it down trough his throut because of the cancer. it was very very much worth it.
                                
                                so in the spirit of john van liempt, 
                                               enjoy"
5,"This was by far one of the best Potato Soup recipes I&apos;ve ever prepared!  It is a bit involved and time consuming (don&apos;t believe the prep or cook times posted here), but it was sooo worth it!  I added carrot and used chicken broth.  Yes, stock is better, but if you don&apos;t have it handy, broth works just fine.  If you&apos;ve read any of my other reviews, you&apos;ll know I&apos;m a fan of red potatoes, skin on; use them in this recipe as well!  In step 3 skip the purée part.  It&apos;s a needless mess and complication!  Near the end, when the potatoes are soft, simply mash it about 4 to 5 times with a masher and achieve the same results, without the time, mess and added cleanup.  Top with your favorite grated cheese, sliced green onion and some crumbles of the bacon you&apos;ve set aside.  Enjoy!"
5,"I have made this soup several times for many different people.  Everyone LOVES it!  I don&apos;t add the tarragon or cilantro nor do I puree at the end, it is still absolutely delicious.  I read in a previous review not to use canned chicken broth...I do!  I&apos;m looking forward to my first cold weather batch, it&apos;s worth every bit of the effort!"
5,"This TRULY is the best potato soup you could ever have. Rich, creamy, full of flavor. You won&apos;t find better in a can or at a restaurant. The only change I will make next time is I&apos;ll use leeks instead of onions. Simply because I think leeks in soup adds the most delicious flavor. You definetly should give this soup a try!"
4,"This was pretty good.  My wife noted that the bacon flavor seemed to overpower everything else, but other than that she really liked it.  
                                
                                I don&apos;t know how to process the words ""too much bacon"", so I can&apos;t comment on that."
4,"I wouldn&apos;t consider this clean eating or low carb however it was good. The flavor was very mild so if you aren&apos;t going to add hot sauce you may need to add more spices. In my opinion if your chicken has been cooking long enough you don&apos;t have to remove it to shred it. It comes apart nicely by just stirring it. Ours was much more ""soupy"" than the photo. It was like a chicken chili. I added sour cream and cheese and served with tortilla chips."
5,"This is a winner! Amazing flavors and the aroma is absolutely sublime. I cooked on Low, expecting to be out all day but came back home mid day...yikes what a test of patience for not getting into the crock pot before cooking time was over. 
                                My husband has his simply with homemade Mexican rice. Mine was in a tortilla topped with cheese and dollops of sour cream with a side of Mexican rice. This is a keeper! Glad I came across your recipe Michelle...
                                P.S. A quick way to shred cooked chicken is to cut breasts in half and place them in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attached. Run on medium (6) speed for 15 to 20 seconds or until the chicken is well-shredded. No stand mixer,then use hand mixer and cut chicken into smaller pieces."
5,"Excellent and easy! I left out the broth  by  mistake but I guess that kept it from being too soupy as some other reviewers mentioned. Had to add a little salt at the end because of that, but nbd. Also left out the cayenne for Hubby&apos;s sake. He gets hiccups when he eats spicy foods! LOL! I was in a hurry and hadn&apos;t planned ahead enough to let it cook for 9 hours, so I cut up the chicken into big chunks, about 4"" each, and cooked it on High for 4 hours. The chicken was fully cooked but still in nice chunks, although it did shred easily if you went at it with a fork. I served it in soup mugs over Mexican rice and the family just loved it! Thanks for posting! (yeah, I know, the rice negated the low-carb thing, but it&apos;s optional! :D  )"
4,"Tweek the recipe to your liking. It&apos;s great base ingredients to start out with! My husband is Mexican so we used red enchilada sauce, and Chipotle salsa in the recipe. alot of cilantro and onions. Topped with tons of Mexican white crumbling queso.(farmers cheese) Thanks."
5,Fantastic dish with such ease to make!! Cooked as directed but I doubled the recepie and added chili powder also used the 32oz. Container of broth! I thought it would be a little more like a soup until I shredded the chicken! Wow! It was very hearty tasty and low carb! Will make again for sure!
5,this is a definite keeper. In place of the seasonings I used a Tbsp of taco seasoning which seemed to work nicely. I ate mine like a dip with tortilla chips and the kids used theirs as burrito filling. This is as &apos;clean&apos; as my eating gets in order to avoid forfeiting flavor... great recipe!
5,"Though I did use chili powder instead of cayenne to temper the heat I made absolutely no other changes. My whole family not only LOVED this but I was asked to officially put it into rotation (that&apos;s what we call my ""go to"" meals that are quick and easy for busy days). As another reviewer said it did turn out more soup like but decreasing the chicken broth (&/or adding more chicken) will change that easily and the soupiness has no bearing on the taste."
5,"Did not use slow cooker at all - made in 20 minutes.  I skipped the broth, used leftover rotisserrie chicken and sub&apos;d the cayenne pepper for some chili pepper and chipotle pepper.  No salt needed.  Served w/ warm tortiallas and a cabbage/green apple salad."
4,"Tasty, easy to add more of your favorite vegetables and make the recipe your own"
2,misleading not low carb.
5,"Wonderful!  I&apos;ve made this twice now, making a lot of the changes suggested in the other reviews.  Both times, I baked the squash first, just putting the whole thing in the oven at 375 for about an hour.  The skin just peels itself off!  Very easy.  I also left out the celery both times.
                                
                                The first time, I replaced the potatoes with sweet potatoes and added some garlic and a pinch of curry powder.  It was absolutely delicious and very hearty served with a big dollop of sour cream (the sour cream is a MUST).
                                
                                The second time, I made it just with butternut squash (no carrots, no potatoes) and it was even better.  I added some cayenne powder for heat and a little nutmeg.  I mixed the sour cream  right into the soup this time - I&apos;ll definitely make this again."
5,"Delicious and easy to prepare.  Others have mentioned a long prep time. This is simplified by NOT dicing the raw butternut squash.  The easiest way to prepare butternut squash is to pierce it with a fork and bake it, whole, at 400F for one hour.  Let cool, then halve lengthwise and remove the seeds.  The flesh scoops out easily with a spoon.  No cutting or dicing required."
3,"This recipe is very, very bland.. however it is salvagable. Here&apos;s what you do: 1- use only one potato, if you use two it takes away from the squash. 2- add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. 3- add 1 T minced garlic. 4- Add 1/4 cup captain morgan&apos;s spiced rum. 5- add 1/2 c half-half. 
                                I personally found the recipe tasted better with a little bit of parmesan cheese and some italian seasonings. Serve with a dollop of sour cream and some crumbled bacon.
                                I strongly recommend making these changes or others, otherwise this recipe is WAY too bland."
5,"Fantastic. We love it with the addition of a clove of garlic and a pinch of curry powder (which doesn&apos;t make it taste like curry, it just brings out the other flavors -- I stole this tip from a 5 star restaurant). The celery adds wonderful flavor; I wouldn&apos;t omit that as others suggest. I use a hand blender (the kind that looks like a wand) to blend it right in the pot so there&apos;s no messy transfer or blender to clean. If you purée soups often the hand blender is very useful."
5,"Very yummy and I will be making this again and again! I always scour the ratings before trying a recipe.  I always end up finding some very useful tips that perfect the outcome of a recipe. The following advice from other reviews were very helpful:
                                1. Use 1 potato, omit the potato all together, or add sweet potato instead.
                                2. For easy dicing, roast the butternut squash in a 400 degree oven for one hour, turning it every 15 minutes.
                                2. For a more flavorful soup, Add 1-2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, a 1/2 tsp of curry, a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.
                                3. Add another 1/2 cup of broth for a thinner consistency after you puree it (but, you be the judge of that).
                                4.  Pureeing it gives it a texture similar to baby food, so you may want to leave some chunks in the soup. 
                                Lastly, If you love squash, you HAVE to try this soup.  My husband was looking for the leftovers the next day and called me a ""dirty dog"" for sending them home with my son.  I regret doing that as well!"
4,"I had never eaten butternut squash so I did not know what to expect.  I thought I had wasted all those ingredients, it was that tasteless.  So I added spices red pepper flakes and some steamed broccoli......Still found it lacking. Then I added some sour cream. OMG, that was the secret. Really good. So I gave it 4 stars because it was, after all, a very good base. I plan to freeze some and see how that does. (7/18/07) After freezing this soup I decided that, although it was better fresh, it was still one of the recipes I will add to my list of foods I can freeze.(10/04/07) Don&apos;t bother to bake the squash. Cut it in half, remove seeds and pulp, place it in a dish, cut side down, with 1/2 inch of water and microwave for 12 to 15 minutes. Works very well!"
5,This soup was one of the best soups I ever made. So simple low fat and tastes incredible! I wouldn&apos;t use the celery again because it didn&apos;t puree properly and was somewhat stringly but other than that this recipe is outstanding.
5,This is a delicious and super EASY soup! I chopped all the vegetables and tosed them into the low fat chicken stock (thus avoided the extras calories by not browning them first!) and when the vegetables were fork tender I pureed the vegetables! Served with a dollop of low fat sour cream and slivers of red pepper and viola! This recipe is the most asked for one this past year 2005!
5,Excellent!  I recommend blending only half of it and leaving the other half chunky to give it some texture.  Definitely perfect for a fall dinner on a cold night!
5,"You should be ashamed of yourself. Family recipes are suppose to be just that, kept in the family. But I&apos;m fo sho glad you shared this one. This is what gumbo is suppose to be.Just the right amount of kick but not to spicy. This will now be passed on down to my family. Thanks Doc!!!"
5,"I was looking for an authentic gumbo recipe and I found it.  I&apos;ve cooked for a long time and try to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it.  As is, this is a great recipe!  I did add a little more Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper the next day since we like things with ""heat"".  My wife said that I outdid myself.  Thank you dailyrecipedoctor and your mother and grandmother."
5,"My family&apos;s favorite gumbo.  It&apos;s fabulous over rice, but if you add two or three cups of water you&apos;ve got the best thick soup type gumbo you&apos;ll ever taste."
5,"5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!  But I must say this the roux is the KEY, if you don&apos;t make this right you can hang it up. 
                                
                                1st things 1st, to get the roux the deep brown that&apos;s authentic to New Orleans style it take WAAAAAAAAAAY longer than 20-30 minutes. Lets double it, it takes 1 hour & using a wisk & constantly stirring on medium low heat. I did adjust the heat to high when starting but was stir quickly like a madman then reduce heat to medium low.  A new orleans native told me the darker you get that roux the better. 
                                
                                2nd - YOU MUST USE FILE POWDER .... it really brings in the flavor and authenticity of New Orleans  Creole taste. Now it was hard to find but you can get it at any health food store some say (Whole Foods) but I got mine down street at Sevenanda health food store. 
                                
                                Yes this recipe is THE BOMB!! and it does take 3 hours & 40 minutes... almost 4 hours depending on how long you stir your roux, I did at least an hour & 10 minutes.
                                
                                Now after adding the seafood, you can remove the whole pot from the eye because the Gumbo will be so hot it will cook your shrimp, scallops, & crab meat. I didn&apos;t add my seafood till the last 5 minutes while on the stove then I removed it from the stove. Let it cooled down naturally , then put in the fridge served it w/ rice & corn muffins... EVERYONE LOVE IT!! I made a huge pot of it in my 8 quart Dutch Oven. 
                                
                                I&apos;m so proud this came out so perfect since it was my 1st attempt to making gumbo."
5,"Great recipe!  I&apos;m from the South and my family always makes gumbo without tomatoes.  I was looking for a different recipe and am glad I found this one.  It&apos;s delicious!  A note about making a roux - stop working so hard!  You can make it in the oven and it is perfection - thanks Alton Brown.  Whisk 4 oz all purpose flour and 4 oz veg oil in a cast iron skillet, place in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every half hour.  It comes out nice and dark and DOES NOT BURN!!!  Once you remove the roux from the oven, follow the recipe directions by adding the celery, bell pepper, etc. and continue with the recipe.  You&apos;re welcome.  ;~)  Oh, and those who are shaming the person who submitted the recipe for giving away a family recipe, get over yourselves!  The submitter never says it was a secret family recipe, just that it was never written down.  We all share recipes our families love, and I am thankful this gumbo recipe was shared!"
5,"Ok. I am a 27 year old straight male that does little to no cooking. I recently got engaged so i wanted to learn a few dishes and  this was my first. When i tell you that everyone LOVED this gumbo i mean EVERYONE. I now have been asked to make it for a superbowl party. The recipt was simple and very easy to make.  I made a couple very small changes but that was my choice. I didnt use the bacon drippings because i burn the first roix i tryed to make ( not much a suprise) and i didnt feel like going to get more bacon so i used butter worked great and got it right the first time. The store was sold out of andouille so i went with the next best thing for texans Earl Camble hot links. Honestly Liked it better then andouille and no one noticed the change. I added shredded chicken breast and used crab legs instead of the lumb crab meat presentation just looks better with the crab legs hanging out the pot and bowls . Other then that followed it to the T and it was the BEST GUMBO I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!! Thanks for sharing this one. And you should be ashamed of yourself for giving away that secret, But im sure glad you did.!!!!!!"
5,THis is one of the best gumbo&apos;s I&apos;ve ever had and my family is from the south so that is saying a lot just dont tell my mother or grandmother. I added shrimp sausage chicken and crab meat. I doubled the recipe and brought over to my inlaws for a family dinner and they all loved it... This will be our gumbo recipe for years to come..
5,I know little about Creole cooking and this is the real deal. I had to add a teaspoon of cayenne simply to add a bit more heat and I used 1 cup of bacon drippings vice 3/4 cup. I doubled the garlic as well.
5,"Merci beaucoup, Madame. Cést délicieux."
2,I was unimpressed. The took a lot of time and effort and had an overwhelming sausage flavor. I wouldn&apos;t make this again.
3,"Ack! ""Do not brown the onions""??? That&apos;s the best part of French Onion soup, the rich, caramelized onions! The ingredients for this soup are great, but I did cook my onions until they were a sweet and dark brown (not burnt) before adding the stock and other ingredients. Try it, you will be amazed at the richness it adds. I also like to toast the French bread a bit before it goes onto the soup, the bread is less slimy soggy if it is toasted."
5,"Delicious!!!! I give this 10 stars with a few minor changes. I used less than half the amount of butter, and PLEASE be sure to caramelize the onions! Instead of sherry, I opted for a dry red wine and make sure you toast your bread before putting under the broiler with the cheese. Otherwise it is just too soggy. Thanks!"
5,"I LOVE French Onion Soup!!  My hubby and I use to have to go to one of our finer restaurants in town (that is not kid-friendly so we had to find a babysitter too) to get the best onion soup in town but thanks to Lori Levin, I can make it myself!  I sliced about 5 large onions and cooked them for about 40 minutes over med heat, stirring them once in a while.  Then I added 1 minced garlic clove in for about one minute before adding 1/2 cup white wine (a bit more than 2 tbsp!).  I let it cook until almost dry then I sprinkled the onions with flour and cooked that (while constantly stirring) for about 3 minutes.  Then I added 5 cans of beef broth and cooked for about 20 minutes.  I used grated Gruyere and this was absolutely the best french onion soup I have ever had and I can&apos;t believe I made it myself!!  Thanks Lori!!"
5,"This is very close to a recipe I have been using for the past 30 years or so.  The only changes/suggestions that I would make are to add a tablespoon of Worchester Sauce and use all butter instead of the olive oil. Make sure that you saute the onions well. (Also, make sure that you slice the onions into fairly wide slices, about 1/2-3/4"" wide.)  You don&apos;t want them burnt, but you do want them browned.  I use Campbell&apos;s Double-Rich Beef Consumme and 1/4 cup of Sherry.    For the cheese, I put a tablespoon of FRESH shredded Parmesan cheese on the bottom of the bowl, then ladle on the soup, then top with a large homemade crouton, then the swiss cheese, and another tablespoon of the fresh Parmesan.    For the croutons, take a large wine-glass and press into a slice of thick bread to get the perfect circle for your soup bowl.  Spread with butter and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.  Put in the oven at 250 for about 1/2 hour or until they are dried and crisp."
5,"After ordering this soup many times at restaurants, this recipe reproduces precisely what French Onion Soup is supposed to taste like. Look, French Onion Soup a challenging soup to eat: chunks of chewy cheese and soggy bread floating on top...but it&apos;s supposed to be that way. I often suggest additions or subtractions to a recipe, but here I suggest you stick with the recipe as is. I&apos;ve made this recipe many times exactly as indicated and everyone loves it. Nice job. Easy to make. Tasty."
4,"The basic recipe is very good with easy to find ingredients.  I didn&apos;t like fighting with all the bland provalone cheese.  So now I use Gruyere and Romano cheeses for more flavor.  
                                The sherry is not optional - buy a good one and add it near the end of cooking.  
                                Use a spanish white onions for more intense flavor (Vidalia if you want it subtler)"
5,"OH-MY-GOSH!!  I cannot believe how simple AND delicious this soup is!!  I doubled the recipe and brought this to our family Sunday fiasco and the crock pot was emptied!!  They LOVED it, not to mention they think I can cook!  I used 1 large vidalia onion, 1 large white onion, and about 4-5 med yellow onions (which I put on my sunglasses & stuck tissue up my nose while slicing, time to invest in a slicer as my hubby really thinks I&apos;m a nut, hey, but it worked)!  I sauteed those in the onion and oil then threw it all in the crotch pot.  Oh and I used half of the full strength broth (10.75 oz Campbells), and half swanson, which is diluted.  And I added the Parmesan to the soup as it brewin&apos;.  Thanks so much Lori, it IS great!"
5,I have tried many french onion soups and this is one of the best. It was not salty nor was it overly sweet it was perfectly seasoned. The only thing I had trouble with was judging how much onion to use. I used two large white onions and found that to be perfect. I cooked the onions for a half hour before I added the broth and used the sherry which I think is necessary in making this. This recipe did not need any additional seasonings it&apos;s perfect as printed.I did use beef stock instead of broth though. The stock I used is Kitchen Basics and it is sold in a juice box like container. Using it will make any soup much better than canned broth! This recipe is a keeper thanks for sharing Lori!
5,"I&apos;ve been trying to perfect the onion soup for years, and this recipe served as a perfect base. I try onion soup every chance i get, and I still say mine is the best. This recipe is simple and delicious as is, but here are my tweaks to take it up a notch into perfect (or as close as i&apos;ve come to date).
                                1. Use 2 Large Yellow Onions/2 Lg Red Onions
                                2. Use 1/2 the butter, that&apos;s simply too much
                                3. Caramelize the onions. Naturally. Throw a couple pinches of salt during this process to help the onions sweat.
                                4. Add 2 cloves minced garlic (w/ onions)
                                5. Use FRESH THYME Bundle and Bay Leaves and add them WITH the onions.
                                6. Use 1C Red Wine to deglaze onions. Bring to Boil then Down to simmer and add broth
                                7. (Here&apos;s my magical twist). 6 Cups of Broth - 4 Beef, 2 Chicken (I use Better than Boullioun paste because it&apos;s not too salty and therefore I can control the salt)
                                8. Add 2 tsp Worcestier Sauce (oh...this is key)
                                9. Chunk and toast french Baguette before adding to soup
                                10. Shredded GRUYERE Cheese. If you can&apos;t find Gruyere, 2 Provolone slices is fine..don&apos;t use Swiss. (still dash some parm/romano on there)
                                
                                Voila."
5,"Outstanding!  Absolutely outstanding!  My darling hubby has been asking for chicken and dumplings for months.  With the weather turning a bit cooler, I decided to give this recipe a try.  I was not disappointed, and neither was he.  These are absolutely delicious.  I used butter rather than margarine and I used two tablespoons rather than one.  These were light, fluffy and so tender.  I followed the recipe and some of the suggestions by other reviewers.  Mix only until incorporated, add to simmering (not boiling) liquid and put a lid on it!  Leave the pot alone for the full 15 minutes.  This is now our family dumpling recipe.  Thank you Carol&apos;s Mom."
5,"I made these to go in ""Grandma&apos;s Chicken Noodle Soup"" and instead of making large dumplings, I made very small ones as requested by my kids, so that they would be bite sized.  The recipe was easy to follow, and the resulting soup was so incredibly good.  It&apos;s a definite keeper!"
5,"I am traumatized from a childhood of eating Bisquick dumplings. This recipe has healed me! I made a simple chicken soup by boiling the chicken and adding carrots, celery and a few potatoes. The dumplings are so tender, flavorful and comforting, they thickened the soup to a perfect consistancy. My kids love it too! It&apos;s a great change from noodles or rice."
5,"I used cooking oil for the fat.  They came out great.  The secret my mom taught me to making ""dough boys"" as we used to call them is to dip your spoon in the liquid between each dumpling so that the batter doesn&apos;t stick to the spoon while scooping.  The dough slides right off the spoon."
4,"Good recipe. One taster said it tasted like a biscuit. The buttermilk dumplings I made at the same time were ""voted"" better. I&apos;ve read that melting the butter and adding it with the milk has the same or better result. Just a thought for anyone who wants to try this recipe. Worth making."
5,"I wanted to make the Chicken and Dumplings III, submitted by Melissa, but I didn&apos;t have any canned bisquits.  Since it was raining I really didn&apos;t want to go to the store so I looked up dumplings and found this recipe.  I&apos;m so glad I did, I just wish I would of made a double batch!!!"
5,"Food Processor Version: WOW! This is the first time I ever made homemade dumplings, fluffy, delicious and much healthier than ready made biscuit dough. I made them in a food processor IN SECONDS as following! I added the flour, salt, bp, sugar, and the 1 tbsp of dried parsley and pulsed a few seconds. I think butter is much healthier than margarine and followed some reviews and used 2 tablespoons of cold butter, but don&apos;t think the extra Tbsp was really necessary.  I pulsed until incorporated, then added the cold milk and pulsed just until the dough pulled together as a ball - not more. I gathered the ball, cut up in pieces with knife, dropped them in my simmering brothy soup and watched them puff up delightfully!-make sure you have enough liquid and let simmer. Do not remove lid during the process!. They tasted awesome and we all loved them. The ingredient ratios are spot on- Don&apos;t change anything! EXCELLENT dumplings Carol!"
4,These dumpling were yummy! One thing that drew me to try them was there was no egg! I love eggs but not overpowering the flavor of the dumplings. They were easy to make. The only thing if you are a dumpling lover is make the recipe times three. I only doubled it and still had plenty of broth for more. For my family chicken and dumpling are just that nothing else.......no veggies nothing. This recipe is a keeper for us.Thanx!
5,"I believe I figured out why some reviewers found the dumplings in the recipe to be ""gummy"", the water wasn&apos;t hot enough to fully cook the dumplings and it gets all gummy. I remade my batch bc it was just that all gummy and goopy, good thing I cooked them separate from my Chicken Parkiash. 
                                
                                Make sure your water is a LIGHT boil before you add the dumplings, then reduce to simmer with lid on- (JUST LIKE THE DIRECTIONS INSTRUCT!)so you don&apos;t make them tough and chewy. I did just that, plus I don&apos;t like the way it changes the texture of the dish when you add directly to the soup/stew-guess it depends on what you were raised on?
                                
                                Plus to address those ppl who found it bland, perhaps you should try it again only use real butter, cold from fridge and add more salt, pepper, parsley as the option offers and I added 1 t each onion and garlic powder plus some chicken granulated bullion, just like 1/2t to the dry ingredients, this made an AMAZING recipe.
                                
                                On its own it is quite tasty I only offered the suggestions to those concerns."
3,I found that forming the dough into small balls keeps the dumplings from falling apart.
5,"This recipe is AWESOME with a few modifications. I made it for my mom, husband, 3 year-old and 8 month old and it was a HUGE hit with all of us! My husband liked it better than his grandma&apos;s homemade chicken and dumplings and the gourmet chef who lives next door tasted it and thought it was an old family recipe. :) He loved it! First, you definitly need to add spices. I used cumin, parsley, poultry seasoning, seasoned salt and pepper. Next, I only used 1 can of biscuits, not 2. (I even used the reduced fat version and they tasted the same!) Thirdly, I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken. Instead of water, I used 3/4 can of low sodium/lowfat chicken broth. At first, it seemed like way to much liquid, but eventually the biscuits soaked it all up! Fourthly, I added 2 CANS of mixed veggies (mix of carrots, peas, tiny potatoes, celery). I am not a fan of canned veggies by any means, but they tasted great in this recipe- so tender! I did add red onion, but I used only half and chopped the pieces extra small. Lastly, I cooked the biscuits for almost 3 hours for a total cooking time of 6.5 hours on high. 30 minutes is just not enough time! Another tip- if you accidentally add too much chicken broth, add a bit of sifted flour and the sauce thickens right up! I know that this recipe will be a winter tradition in our household for years to come!"
5,"Excellent! Only adjustments needed are as follows:  Use 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (as directed- don&apos;t deviate with other cream soups) cover with 1 14 oz can of chicken broth (no need to cover with water, dillutes flavor).  Put torn biscuit dough in roughly 90 minutes before ready to serve and make sure that you push them down into the liquid mixture a little, so that they get cooked on the tops, too and saturated with the chicken flavor.  I made this recipe with veggies and without, it was better WITHOUT, because the consistency was better and the veggie flavor soaked into the dumplings. 5 hours on High is MORE than enough total cooking time.  Also, leave chicken partially frozen when starting out and don&apos;t tear meat until right before adding dumplings, this keeps chicken moist.  THIS ONE&apos;S A WINNER!!!!"
5,"Sorry if this get long winded, but I love dumplings. I cant believe how good this recipe is! Ive been raised on my Great Grandma&apos;s recipe from West Virgina, and was sure this would be horrible. It was really good, and I just changed a few things to make it more like Na-Na&apos;s. I used one can of cream of chicken soup and one can of cream of celery soup. I added some celery tops with leaves(removed after cooking). And just so theres no confusion, the biscuits will turn into dumpling (like noodles) NOT drop biscuits like you would expect. The only thing I would do differently would be to roll the dough out into small pancake sizes and cut that into strips. (The dumplings were just a little doughy-er than we are used to.)A little salt and pepper, and  with those changes, this would be as close to the all day version as you can get. My husband could&apos;nt tell the difference! Really good! Thank-you Janiece."
5,"Wonderful recipe.  And for all the morons who simply make a totally different recipe by their additions, subtractions, cooking a bit longer or shorter...try posting your own recipe and stop giving 4 stars to a perfectly good recipe.  All recipes are guidelines.  We all have different tastes, so either like the recipe or leave it.  tiny.mama"
5,I&apos;m giving this 5 stars for it&apos;s easiness and flavor. It tastes close enough to homemade to be really enjoyable. I used 2 cans cream of chicken 1 can chicken broth and 1 & 1/2 soupcans of water to cover 2 FROZEN (helps keep it tender) chicken breasts (just 2 of us). I added the water b/c I was worried about the salt and was glad I did. Cooked on low 8-9 hours adding 1 can biscuits 2 hrs before eating. It was very good! I&apos;m biased b/c I was raised on the best dumplings of all time (my mom&apos;s) so of course they&apos;re not quite homemade but hubby devoured this and I liked it too! The chicken was SO TENDER I was very surprised! I think cooking on low and not cutting up the chicken into chunks before cooking is key so the juices don&apos;t just leak out... they get stored in the breast which u can pull apart later. This is great if you&apos;re learning to cook in college or just in a pinch for a great meal! Simple yummy and comforting! Thanks for a great recipe & quick lifesaver! We barely had leftovers! Leftover chicken could easily be turned into a soup or even enchiladas the next day! UPDATE 8-27-07: Veggies add water so adjust accordingly or skip water altogether. Right before adding biscuits if liquid&apos;s too watery mix a few TBSPNs of flour with cold water & stir into crock pot to thicken. Also cut biscuits into quarters. Cranking up heat to high during biscuit cooking made them cook faster and better - 1 hr instead of 2. So far Pillsbury&apos;s Grands Homestyle Buttermilk biscu
5,This was great! I made changes as suggested by others. I used 8 small breasts used chicken broth instead of water added a bit of white wine (less than 1/4 cup). I seasoned the chicken before cooking with seasoned pepper garlic powder chicken seasoning and paprika. I added fresh celery along with the onion. I added green peas & water & flour for thickening before I added the biscuits. I flattened the biscuits and cut into strips and seasoned with salt & pepper on both sides. Cooked an additional 2 hours on high without opening the lid and it was perfect.
5,"It really irritates me that people give a recipe 5 starts and then proceed to change it so that it&apos;s not even the same recipe anymore.  If you don&apos;t like the recipe as is then don&apos;t give it a high rating - post your own separately somewhere else!  That&apos;s not only rude, but it&apos;s misleading."
5,WONDERFUL!! I used chicken broth instead of water and did not use the onion. Did season with salt pepper and a little onion powder. I put on low in morning before going to work and let cook all day. I shredded the chicken(had used frozen chicken breasts) and turned to high and added 2 cans of biscuits each biscuit into 4 pieces. Let cook 1-11/2 hrs on high. Was absolutely the BEST!!
4,I finally made this recipe today for our Sunday lunch. This was very tasty with my changes. First of all I have the oblong slow cooker so I used 6 small to medium sized breasts first I poured half of a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the slow cooker then placed the chicken that was seasoned with salt pepper poultry seasoning and paprika then I placed the onions on top then a can of cream of chicken soup can of cream of celery soup then the remaining chicken broth. One hour and 45 minutes before serving I shredded the chicken. Then I put the store brand Texas style regular biscuits that I had quartered on top. One can of 10 count biscuits was plenty! This turned out very well and not too liquidy. This will be great to add veggies to and also for cold days. My 16 year old son ate this up like he hadn&apos;t been fed in years. Thanks for the post!
3,Super Easy! I liked it but my husband didn&apos;t...figures
4,"Based on comments here, I made some substitutions and I think this is the best lentil soup I&apos;ve had in a long time. I added another 2 carrots, I doubled all the spices. I added 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes, I bought a can of 28oz. crushed tomatoes. I added the 14.5 oz. that the recipe called for, then used the rest mixed with 4 cups of broth and water to make the 8 cups of ""water"". I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup red lentils, I used 3 T. of lemon juice instead of vinegar, and I added about 3 Tablespoons of port. I guess that&apos;s a lot of changes, but trust me, people can&apos;t stop eating it. It&apos;s really great."
5,"This is a phenomenal recipe. Having lived in Spain and enjoyed true lentil soup, I thought I&apos;d never again appreciate an american version. Boy was I wrong. My adaptations to this great recipe include: 4 carrots, 2 bay leaves, 4 garlic cloves, 8 cups chicken broth instead of water. In the last 30 minutes I add 4 cups spinach, three potatos, and smoked sausage. I blend half and then add back for a really nice texture. This is served great with parmesean cheese and garlic/ mozerella bread."
5,"This is great lentil soup.  My husband said that it was better than any he had had.  I added extra garlic and spinach and omitted the olive oil to cut fat. Also, have tried wine vinegar and balsamic, balsamic is best.  Very ""meaty"" and tasty, I would definitely recommend."
5,This soup is the bizzomb. My family ate this up like vultures on a carcass. The only thing I added was the four beers that I drank while cooking.
5,"This lentil soup is excellent!  Definately one of the best I have found, although I did have to make some changes to suit my tastes.  I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2, added 1 teaspoon each of cumin and curry powder and used 2 cups chicken broth and 6 cups water.  Turned out very good and flavorful.  I also did not see any reason to use so much oil, so I cut that back to 1 tablespoon and that was plenty to saute the vegetables.  The addition of spinach is wonderful and the use of balsamic vinegar really makes a differance. Wonderful soup recipe that I will keep on using!"
5,"This is my second review of this recipe (after making my third batch of soup).   I neglected to mention in my first review that I used Stewed Tomatoes (more flavor).  Because of this, I did not add salt.  Also, I used 1/2 of a frozen package of spinach.  I saved the rest for another batch.  We served the last batch over thin spaghetti and found it to be a complete, filling lunch/dinner.  Also, sprinkling with parmesan cheese as noted in other reviews was very good.   I notice that my first review got eliminated.  The point I made there was to use Herb Ox Low Sodiumn Powder Bouillon rather than the regular bouillon (5 grams of sodiuim as opposed to over 1000).  I also put in a couple of dashes of hot chili sauce for a little extra flavor and oomph!!!
                                Also, I have a Vita Mix and chopped all of the vegetables in it -- quite a time saver."
5,Very good. I did decrease the oil to 1 tblsp. and added about 1/2 tsp. cumin. It made about 10 cups of soup. Weight Watchers: (with 1 tblsp. oil) this works out to be 2.5 points per cup in my calculations.
5,"I made this recipe and scaled it for 42 since it was going to be a main dish for our school&apos;s teacherstaff appreciation lunch. I used stewed tomatoes and vegetable broth which made it vegetarian so those teachers and staff who are vegetarians could enjoy it too. It was well liked, (I loved it!) although I noticed something a few days later. With the leftovers, the spinach was quite yucky and the color became uniform, so it did not look as appealing. I thought it still tasted good, although the flavors all blended a little too much by then making it less flavorful. But if I was making it again and knew ahead of time there would be leftovers I would simply take out the extra BEFORE adding the spinach and fridge it."
5,"this soup is going to be a staple in my winter kitchen. i added my own variations, incorporating some of the other suggestions:
                                
                                two jalapenos diced (some seeds,)
                                two zucchini diced,
                                4 cloves garlic minced,
                                vegetable stock,
                                28 oz can of crushed tomatoes (not 15 oz),
                                tablespoon of ginger (store bought grated),
                                balsamic vinegar (not white),
                                & i pureed half of the recipe in a blender to thicken it up a bit.
                                
                                YUM!"
1,"How anyone could give this a high rating is a mystery to me. I followed the recipe completely, and it had almost no flavor--kind of like highly diluted salt-free ketchup. I added a scoop of beef Better than Bouillon, which helped a little. A bunch of seasoned croutons on top made it edible but still not good. My wife and I managed to eat one bowl apiece."
5,"This is the quickest thing I have made for dinner in a long time.  However, I like my chili on the thicker side, and this chili was a little too watery.  To solve this problem, I added half a can of tomato paste, and this made it perfect.  I also added just a little extra chili powder because I wanted it to be a little spicier.  Because I didn&apos;t have stewed tomatoes, I used canned diced tomatoes instead.  They were just as good and gave the chili a nice flavor.  I have already made this for dinner twice, and I plan on making it a staple in my recipe collection.  It&apos;s great served with a portion of baguette."
5,Wow!!! This chili was GREAT.  This was my first time EVER to make chili.  I added a chopped green pepper and 2 cloves of garlic minced in the pan with the hamburger and onions..  I also used 1 tablespoon of chili powder.. This truly was better than any chili my family has ever had from any restaurant or family member.. Thank you so much.
5,"It has snowed 5 feet here in Denver and I really wanted chili tonight. I can&apos;t believe how easy this was!!! It was sooooooooooooo good. I can&apos;t believe it. I tastes like I worked all day on it. I did make a few changes, I only put 1c. of water, and put about 1TB of chili powder. When I browned the meat I put 2 cloves of garlic in with onion. This was the tastiest dinner I&apos;ve had! Thanks!"
2,"It was good, although I had to make too many changes to the recipe to rate it any higher. I used alot more garlic and chili powder(1-2 tbsp) and I omitted the water completely(I like it thick and it was just too soup-like with the water in it). As the recipe is now it was very bland tasting."
4,"I decided to make chili dogs at the last minute for National Hot Dog Day, I needed something fast. This fit the bill perfectly. I increased the chili powder and garlic powder and added a few more spices (cumin, mexican oregano, crushed red pepper, onion powder, little brown sugar, little Worchestershire sauce) for flavor. This worked out great."
4,This is an easy and simple chili recipe. I used petite diced tomatoes. I usually throw in garlic and green pepper. I use a TON more chili powder than called for here. We like it spicy! We serve this with shredded cheese and sour cream. The kids like to have this over fritos. Every once in a while I will serve this as a taco salad with corn chips and all the fixins.
2,"I don&apos;t see how anyone can rate a recipe 4-5 stars when they have to practically redo it.  I added this, I left out that...put in more seasoning, leave out the water...either a recipe works or it doesn&apos;t AS IS.  This is a basic starter recipe for new cooks or families w/ young children. It doesn&apos;t qualify as 4-5 stars in my book."
5,This was so easy to make and tastes great!! My husband and I both loved it! I only had marinara sauce on hand so I used that in place of the tomato sauce. AND I had to cook the chili a lot longer than 15 minutes to get it thick enough. I&apos;ll definitely be making this one again but I think I&apos;ll add less water next time around...
4,Easy to make and tasty. I added some hot chili powder and barley. Came out very good.
5,"In a word, WONDERLICIOUS!  I knocked this recipe out of the park on my first try.  Here&apos;s what I did (and what you should do too): in melted butter, sauté 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 cup chopped onion, 1 cup chopped celery, and 1 cup sliced carrots.  Meanwhile, chop 1/2 pound uncooked boneless, skinless chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Add chicken, the broth, basil, oregano, salt, garlic pepper, a dash or two of poultry seasoning, and a pinch or two of dried thyme to the pot of veggies. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, cook 3 cups egg noodles according to package directions in a separate pot.  Add drained noodles to chicken and veggies, simmer an additional 10 minutes. Only if you want some creaminess, go ahead and add a half can of condensed cream of whatever soup (whatever flavor you choose).  Voilà! A SIX-star chicken noodle soup!"
5,"Vincenza...I could kiss you for this recipe.  My 15 month old and I had a bad flu and she refused to eat any soup from the can.  I was ill and at my wits end and found this recipe.  I had all ingredients in the house (except for celery) and whipped this together.  I didn&apos;t have the vegetable broth and had to improvise with some chicken broth granules to make all the necessary broth.  I cubed raw chicken and boiled it in the soup to save time.  I also added garlic.  I made egg noodles on the side and added it as we ate it so the soup wouldn&apos;t get starchy.  This soup was not only easy but AMAZING!  Probably the best chicken soup I&apos;ve eaten.  UPDATE:  I&apos;m still eating this on a regular weekly basis.  I make a batch almost weekly and it freezes excellent (if you don&apos;t add pasta to it until you&apos;re ready to serve).  I now ALWAYS use vegetable broth as I really feel it adds to the flavor.  I sautee the celery, onions and carrots along with garlic to soften them up.  I also buy a rotisserie chicken and use the whole thing to make a huge batch of this soup.  I triple all veggies and my 20 month old daughter eats the veggies out of the soup by the handful!  This freezes REALLY well if you don&apos;t add pasta until you&apos;re ready to serve.  This is a definite keeper and is still the best homemade chicken soup I&apos;ve had."
5,"GREAT recipe! A few changes I made are...I sauteed the carrots along with the onion (they end up more tender), I didn&apos;t use any veg broth but all homemade chicken broth (it&apos;s richer), I added minced garlic along with the othe veggies that cook in the butter, and I doubled the noodles (this made it more a chicken & noodles dish but it was delish!).  This is a great way to usue a rotisserie (sp?) chicken on the second day.  I really really recommend this recipe! I also freezes well!"
5,"This is so easy to make and so good!  I cook the chicken breasts in the broth to make the broth a bit richer, then build the soup from there."
5,I used all chicken broth (part homemade & part store bought broth in the box) Used fresh basil and fresh oregano from my garden and threw in some dried herbes de provence(an incredibly versatile herb mixture)Sauteed the sliced carrots with the onion and celery. Made the recipe for 8 and that made generous servings for 6 people. Everyone had 2 bowls. Delicious. Served with big green salad rolls fresh fruit and brownies for dessert.
4,"I followed the recipe only adding 6 cloves of minced garlic. I used homemade chicken broth/vegetable broth and I used the ""No Yolks"" egg noodles. After tasting it I did increase the basil and oregano. This was quick to make and quite comforting for someone who&apos;s been sick for what seems like ages. Next time I&apos;ll increase both the onion and celery as I like a chunkier soup."
5,"My friend told me last week that I needed to check out this web site.  So I did and join the same day.  Today my daughter was sick when she got up.  I got on the web site to find a chicken soup recipe and found a lot of them.  This one is so easy to fix and that&apos;s what I was looking for.  My daughter is not a good eater and when your sick your really don&apos;t feel like eating.  She has  had 2 bowls now.  My husband and I also loved it.  I did put 1 cup of celery, onion, and carrots.  It was so rich and hearty.  Thank you for this submitting this recipe."
5,This was the first homemade chicken noodle soup I ever made. It is VERY GOOD! I was expecting something different than the way it turned out but it is delicious all the same. I did nearly doubly the noodles and I doubled the veggies. The only problem I had was that the noodles lost their spiral shape when the soup was done--they cooked too long. I may cook them separately next time. I have to say...while I am sure there are better recipes out there somewhere this one is quick cheap and easy! And as another reviewer said it makes me not want to buy another canned chicken noodles soup again. And I don&apos;t think that I will unless I have to! I really like this! Good and flavorful!
5,"Excellent chicken noodle soup recipe.  Very easy and has a homemade taste.  I did not cook the chicken first.  I simmered it in the broth with the vegetables for more flavor.  Used frozen egg noodles and added garlic.  Also added two cans of condensed cream of chicken soup for a creamier soup.  I would recommend tasting it before adding salt, it may not be necessary to add salt if not using low sodium chicken broth."
3,Good but nothing extraordinary. Great base to start from. Thanks!
5,"I read every single review (all 114) prior to making this soup, so I changed a few things.  It turned out wonderfully!!  Here&apos;s how I did it:  I diced two boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooked them prior to starting with the olive oil, 2 cloves garlic and 1/2 cup diced onion.  Then I added 4 cans condensed chicken broth (many people said the soup was very thick - chili-like consistency, and I wanted more of a soup).  I also added a can of water (filled a broth can with water).  I added the crushed tomatoes (28 oz), the hominy (15 oz), the diced green chili peppers (4 oz), 1 tsp each of cumin (instead of oregano as many reviewers suggested), lime juice and garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp of chili powder.  I brought to a boil and let simmer for 1 hour (as others also suggested).  Top with shredded monterey jack cheese and garnish w/ tortilla chips.  EXCELLENT!  My husband said it tasted just like the chicken tortilla soup we&apos;d had at Chili&apos;s - which was what I was aiming for!!  I think the sour cream would have been a good topping as well, maybe next time.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!"
5,"My husband and I loved this soup - it tastes just like the chicken tortilla soup I&apos;ve had at restaurants.  I made the following changes.  I first sauteed cut up chicken breast in a little olive oil, with salt and pepper and garlic powder, and then I shredded the chicken.  I used 4 cloves of garlic, because we love garlic!  I substituted 2 tsp of cumin for the oregano.  I added 2 cans of chicken broth and omitted the water.  I don&apos;t particularly like hominy, so I substituted 2 cups of frozen white corn.  And I didn&apos;t have any canned green chile peppers, so I used half a can of diced jalepenos.  I topped off the soup with Monterey Jack Cheese, crushed tortilla chips, fresh minced Cilantro and a little sour cream .  It was wonderful!  I served the soup with Mexican cornbread (basically cornbread mix to which I added diced jalepenos and 1 1/2 cups of Monterey Jack).  I definitely be making this soup again !"
5,"I can&apos;t say enough good things about this recipe!! Suffice to say that I&apos;ve made it at least 6 times in the past several months.  It&apos;s such a good, hearty soup, and so easy to make. I&apos;ve made it for friends several times and EVERYONE has asked for the recipe. Here&apos;s what I&apos;ve learned: 
                                1) Make sure you use FRESH cilantro.  It truly does make a difference.
                                2) I bake the chicken and chop it up (rather than shredding) using my Pampered Chef hand chopper. REALLY fast and much easier than shredding.
                                3) Eliminate the water and use another can of chicken broth instead.
                                4) Omit the oregano - use 1 teaspoon of cumin (as others suggested) instead.
                                5) Rather than shredding Monteray Jack, I find that Kraft shredded Mexican cheese works just as well and is easier/faster.
                                6) I&apos;ve never had a ripe avacado on hand, and though I&apos;m sure it would be good, it&apos;s not necessary because this soup is already delicious. 7)I add sour cream as an additional garnish."
2,"Not sure if people are rating this recipe based on their personal revisions, but as written this recipe does not deliver. It&apos;s too watery, it needs more time to cook, and it completely lacks in spice/flavor. Luckily I had a couple ingredients on hand to fix it, and the end result was wonderful and the whole family asked to have it again (soon). So I will share my changes:  1) Use shredded chicken - it&apos;s more like what you&apos;d get in a restaurant. 2) Let this soup simmer in a crock pot - I did it on low for a total of 5 hours. It thickens the soup and helps the flavors blend. 3) Substitute the water for chicken broth (I used a total of 3 cups of broth). 4) Skip the hominy - one cup of corn is enough. Add an extra 4oz can of green chilis.  5) ADD A PACKET OF TACO SEASONING (I had McCormick&apos;s on hand) and increase the chili powder by 1 tsp. Add a sprinkle of cumin and a little salt (or garlic salt). 6) Add 8-10 finely crushed tortilla chips (baked are ok) into the soup (they&apos;ll cook down so you won&apos;t have crunchy bites but they add a good flavor - it is TORTILLA soup, right?) 7) After simmering for 4 1/2 hours, stir in 1/2 cup of sour cream. Continue to simmer for 30 minutes. This is what really puts the soup over the top and gives is a creamy texture similar to what I&apos;ve had in most restaurants. 8) Serve with diced avocado, shredded cheese, and more tortilla chips for crumbling.  End result - awesome!"
4,"Not like the tortilla soup I had in Mexico, but very good with some changes other reviewers suggested. I started with the base and it tasted bland so I added cumin and more chili powder (salt and pepper to taste) and let this simmer (after only 10 minutes the tomatoes still taste raw). I recommend an hour.  Towards the end, add the chicken and beans-they only need to be heated through.  I have no clue what condensed chicken broth is, so I used regular broth. I ended up adding 2 more cups of chicken broth, as it was too thick. Topped with cheese, tortilla chips, Franks hot sauce and sour cream and it was pretty and delicious!"
4,So delicious!! I only gave this four stars because this is the second time I&apos;ve made it; the first time I followed the recipe exactly but this time I modified it slightly. My changes made it even better! I used a pre-cooked chicken omitted the oregano and cilantro added 1 tsp cumin and used 1 tsp regular chile powder plus 1 tsp ancho chile powder. It was aMAzing!! I STRONGLY recommend the ancho chile powder to those who can find it...it gave it such an awesome flavor! Next time I may just use all ancho and none of the regular... Will DEFINITELY make again!!
4,"GREAT - We are big soup lovers and make many kinds of soup all year round. My husband, son and I love this soup. I have made this soup at least 4 times over the last year. I usually double the recipe and saute the chicken breasts in a little olive oil with garlic powder and black pepper then shred before adding to the soup just before the simmering step. I also use additional chicken broth instead of water and add 1 jar of salsa. Sometimes I add hominy, sometimes not. I also add cumin and some lemon juice to taste. HOWEVER, I always let the soup simmer for at least a hour or more on low heat to let the flavors come together. This makes it even better the next day. This is very good topped with sour cream, chopped green onions and shredded cheddar or pepper jack cheese."
5,We loved this soup! I didn&apos;t add the oregano because that seems like an Italian herb. Instead I added cumin. Be sure to use crushed tomatoes and not whole or chopped. The crushed is thicker the others are too watery.
4,"Excellent lightly spicy soup Star! I think the base flavor needed ""something"" though. The oregano was a little too prominent to me. I added 1/4 cup red wine (boil off the alcohol for a few minutes) Did the trick. WAY GREAT! Oh and I thought it needed to be cooked a little LONGER (10-15 minutes simmering) to blend flavors. If you do don&apos;t add the (we prefer slightly shredded to chunks)chicken until last few minutes or it will be ""mushy"". If you like chili and chicken TRY THIS RECIPE. You won&apos;t even need the toppings-great without too!"
5,"Mmm ... good. My husband made this for dinner tonight, changing only the quantity of water. (He used less &apos;cause he doesn&apos;t like soupy beans.) Oh, and he didn&apos;t know we had ham, so he only used the ham hocks. Still, this was deee-lish. I actually had seconds, which I hardly ever do. Oh, and you have to cook them longer than 2 1/2 hours. Just test them every half hour or so after that, and throw the ham in when they&apos;re about done. BTW, if you cook dried beans to death and they are still gritty or mealy, it&apos;s because they&apos;re too old; even dried beans don&apos;t last forever. They have a moisture content that lessens with age. No recipe can make old beans taste good."
5,"This soup turned out terrifically, but that&apos;s because I read all of the other reviews before making it, and attempted to fix the problems other people had noted:  (1) to get tender beans, I soaked the dry beans overnight, discarded the water, and made the soup  with fresh water, simmering for 2 hours--the beans were nice and tender; (2) to make the soup less watery, I used 6 1/2 cups water instead of 8--the soup turned out thick and hearty; (3) to avoid saltiness, I didn&apos;t add any salt, and used turkey ham instead of the traditional stuff, eliminating the ham hock as well (this may not have affected the saltiness, but it sure cut down on fat and calories).  It&apos;s an easy recipe to experiment with--have fun and enjoy!"
5,"Yep... this is pretty good (it&apos;s how I make mine).  But, why stop with Northern beans?  I use every kind of bean and dried pea I can get my hands on.  And I never take the time to soak my dried beans.  I ""de-gas"" them by just covering them with water, adding about a tablespoon of baking soda, and bringing them to a rolling boil - about 3 times.  After each boil, drain and run clean water over them to remove the husks.  Then add the rest of your ingredients and cook away!  You&apos;ll find the other beans/peas give your soup a much more ""full"" flavor.  And the ""de-gassing"" ... well... de-gasses them! LOL  Try it - I think you&apos;ll like it."
3,"This is a good basic recipe with one improvement.  The secret to any good soup is the stock from which it is made.  So first, the ham stock should be made separately from any other ingredients because it takes a few hours to get the ham flavor fully out of a ham bone.  I would also use ham hocks in addition to (or in lieu of) the ham bone, because ham hocks have many joints and contribute a lot of protein richness to the stock.  A properly done stock will actually gel if stored in fridge - the gel is the protein not the fat.  Once the stock is made, you can strain it and toss the ham hocks and bone out because if done correctly, the flavor from the hocks and bones has now been transferred into the stock.
                                
                                Once the stock is done, add the beans only, and cook till done.  Finally add the more tender ingredients like veggies and ham meat.  Cook as long as you like for your veggie tenderness.
                                
                                Like any soup, it benefits from a night in the fridge before eating!"
5,"Excellent, excellent soup!  Use chicken broth (mostly), leave out the salt (my ham had enough), and cook in the crock pot (that&apos;s the easiest way, since the beans do have to cook a while).  I soaked the beans overnight, then put EVERYTHING in the crock pot and cooked from 9 - 5 on HIGH. Puree about 4 cups of mixture in blender around half way through and put back into pot (makes it creamier).  Add more broth/water if it&apos;s too thick.  Take out bay leaves and bone at the end, and cool for a little while if you want (will be really hot if you don&apos;t). Husband and kids 8 and 11 loved it. 6 yr old...well, she&apos;s still picky."
5,Oh my gosh!  I followed other reviewers advice and subbed 4 cups of chicken stock for water and was so surprised by how much flavor this soup has. I let it simmer several hours on super bowl sunday and it thickened up great. Even better next day.  This is THE best recipe I&apos;ve tried here.
5,"For years I&apos;ve been craving the bean soup I used to get at a deli on the town square in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. I saw this recipe and had to give it a try. After reading the reviews, I decided to use the crockpot method recommended earlier. The result? A delicious, hearty, bean soup that my whole family enjoyed and has rated ""a keeper"". One note here: instead of ham hocks I used the bone from a spiral sliced ham (honey flavor). Enough meat was on the bone that I didn&apos;t need to add anymore, and it had a nice, smokey flavor."
5,"Taking note of some of the comments on this soup, I soaked my beans overnight first, and did not add salt.  I do think it was plenty salty, and would have been too salty with added salt.
                                
                                This is one of the best bean soups I have ever had, and was very easy to make.  I am not the best at soups, so I was thrilled with how simple this was, and how well it turned out."
5,"The flavor of this wonderful soup is anything but basic.  I&apos;ve made this twice so far and loved it both times.  To help make the beans soft, add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda to the soaking water; it helps in breaking down the outer shell.  However, do remember to drain off the water with baking soda and use fresh water for making the soup.  I took two cups of the soup, pureed and added back into the soup to thicken it."
5,"Your basic chicken soup recipe found in most general cook books. It is the old reliable of chicken soup recipes. I appreciated the hint to cut the carrots, celery and onions in half. I had always cut them up in small pieces, and then when I would drain the broth, it was messy to try to retrieve the cut up veggies to put them back in the broth. This is so much easier! When I drain the broth, I place a paper towel in the sieve. It makes for a nice clear broth. I also cook up some noodles to add to the soup. I do not like to add the noodles directly to the pot of soup, because the noodles will aborb too much of the broth."
3,"I give this a three as written. But with changes it moves up to a four. I added some fresh herbs, and did not use the veggies that were in the stock, because the veggies had lost all of there flavor. I used freshly chopped veggies. Then I added 2 cups of water with 2 cubes of chicken bouillon."
5,"Absolutely wonderful recipe! I used about 2 1/2 lbs. of cut up chicken and used 4 packets of Goya Chicken Bouillon and I think that probably was the secret to seasoning this soup.  I used baby carrots and put two whole (scrubbed with the peel on) potatoes in the bottom of the pot with chicken.  I followed the instructions and let it cook, took the chicken off the bone and returned everything to the pot after I cut up the veggies.  I then added some frozen vegetable soup cut veggies (celery, peas, onion, potatoes, okra, etc.) and ditalini pasta.  My son has a cold and this soup really hit the spot with him, even in 110 degree weather! I really recommend this soup recipe!  I put half in individual containers in our freezer and my son, who wants soup every day, will be set for at least a few days!"
4,"This recipe is very tasty though it is also very basic - which is perfect for the beginner chef.  Once you begin to ""doctor"" your own recipes, you will see that the more flavors you add to chicken broth, the better. For example, why stop with carrots and celery? In addition to these things, I add a potato, tomato, fresh basil, fresh parsley, red peper, onion, etc... Make sure to be generous with the salt as stock can be quite bland unless seasoned appropriately. I even use a couple of bay leaves and a couple of peppercorns during the cooking process.  Bring the liquid to a boil, then turn the heat down and simmer. I use a lid on my soup to keep evaporation to a minimim, though I ""vent"" the lid with a wooden spoon during cooking (kind of props up the lid) so that it isn&apos;t completely sealed shut...  Add water 1/2 way through cooking if necessary.  Boullion is OK, but not necessary if you have the appropriate blend of chicken, veggies and herbs.  Serve with rice or your noodle of choice.  Never cook noodles in the broth - always in a separate pot because the starch will ruin your soup. The more you times you make this recipe, the more you will enjoy it - as it is definitely a process of trial and error. ENJOY!"
5,"Wonderful soup, I cooked the soup w/out carrots & potatoes most of the day, adding them in the last hour.  For a little extra taste I added some cumin.  The whole family loved it, great for a blustery and rainy day here in the great northwest!"
4,"Pretty good soup. I used a roasted chicken carcass from our previous nights dinner as I feel it adds more flavor then the uncooked chicken. I also used canned chicken broth in lieu of the water, along with my usual seasonings. We&apos;re eating a lot of soup these days as it&apos;s frigid here in northwest N.J.! Thanks Jill!"
5,"Yummy. I followed the recipe as written - and at the end - added ""uncooked star shaped pastas"" and cooked an additional 10 minutes - making it Homemade Chicken Soup with Stars. I submitted a photo of the finished project."
5,This is a great recipe to work with as your base for your own chicken noodle soup. I usually follow the general idea of it to make my stock adding a bunch of garlic and a couple other spices. Then I add my own veggies to the soup. If you like beans in your chicken soup add beans. Basically add whatever you enjoy!
5,"This was the first time making Chicken Soup from scratch and I was surprized at how simple it was. My husband wanted homemade noodles with it so I used Pat&apos;s recipe for ""Basic Pasta"" and it turned out GREAT! We added the noodles to the soup and let them boil for about 15 minuites and served. I saved the leftovers and they tasted even better the second time!!! I also added a bit more water while the chicken was boiling. I will definatly be making this again!"
5,"Tried a healthier version of this soup (down from 60 grams of fat per serv. to 8!!) Cut out the butter completely (we didn&apos;t even miss it amazingly) used 6 cups of 2% milk, reduced fat sharp cheddar, reduced fat sour cream.  Reserved a 1/4 cup each of sour cream and cheese plus all of the bacon crumbles & used 1tbsp each to top each serving. DELICIOUS - never would have thought it healthy!  I also used about 6 potatos and coursley mashed them as opposed to cubed. YUM!"
4,"I read every review only because I believe that even experienced cooks can always learn something. Some people complained that the soup was bland. At first taste, while it was still in the pot, I agreed. It tasted like soupy mashed potatoes. I added garlic and onion powder, parsley and cayenne pepper for some zip. When I initially viewed the recipe I felt that there was way too much butter/flour. I cut both back by half, not only to cut down on the fat, but because other reviewers stated that the soup was too thick. You definitely don&apos;t need all that roux to make this soup thick. If you do want it thicker, just add more potato, if you want it thinner, add more milk or chicken broth. This is the kind of recipe that you can put in whatever spices, herbs or meats that suit your own taste. You really can&apos;t ruin it. Overall, it was very good."
5,I make this soup all the time and my family loves it. To thin it down some I use 3 cups of milk and add chicken broth to our preferred thickness. The chicken broth adds even more flavor too!!!
5,"Fantastic!! Better than any potato soup I&apos;ve had in a restaurant and definitely my fav soup ever!! I have done a bit of tweaking to suit my own tastes.... sub 2 cups chicken stock for 2 of the cups of milk, instead of green onions I add a finely chopped yellow onion and 2 cloves garlic that I&apos;ve lightly browned in the bacon grease. I mash the potatoes a little bit with fork as well, cut the sour cream down a bit, save about half of the cheese and all of the crumbled bacon to top the soup with. It&apos;s even more flavorful and thick the next day.  If it gets too thick I just add a little milk when reheating."
5,This was great meal.  My husband and I loved it.  But we did something a little diffrent.  It did not have much flavor.  So we got a ranch packet out.  The one that you make the ranch dressing with and just added some to the soup and it turned out great.  We did nto add all of it just enough for taste.  Just thought this might help.
1,"This recipe does have potential, I wish I could omit the star rating, but that feature no longer works.  I tried this recipe exactly, but it was bland and had a thick flour taste.  My hubby said it reminded him of the paste from when he was in grade school.  If this sits for any length of time it becomes similiar to mashed potatos..  For all of you who said it was ""bland"" or ""milky"", try omitting 3 cups of milk and instead, cook half of your potatos in 3 cups of chicken broth.  Puree those, but bake the other half of the taters and cut them in small cubes.  Add you milk to the tater puree and heat to a simmer, you should not need the roux, potatos are a natural thickener.  I would recommend adding some salt, garlic powder and maybe even some chopped onion to the broth before you cook the potatoes, for added flavor.  Continue with the recipe ingreadiens and enjoy."
5,"I love this recipe!  Can I give it more than five stars?  I have made it several times now and it is a favorite at our house making a meal in itself.  I will throw in about half of the potatoe skins for a little extra texture.  The really nice thing about this soup is you can adjust it to taste.  I have added everything from the onion, sour cream and bacon they suggest to steak and chives.  It is also really easy and quick unlike my potato soup recipe which I have to cook for several hours and usually forget about scorching the milk."
5,This was exelent. It tasted a little bland the day that I made it.  By the second day all of the flavors came out. It was perfect!! I sugest letting it sit over night.
4,VERY good soup. I recommend being careful how much flour you put in though. I put too much in. The thickness comes at the final stages so don&apos;t worry if it seems thin. Also I like it with more potato and bacon in it like a chowder. I will definately be making this during the winter.
5,"DELISH!!  I have been making Pea Soup the same way for over 20 years and I have never ever ""sweat"" the onion, celery and garlic prior to adding the ingredients in the order of this recipe and I believe that THIS IS KEY to an AMAZING HAM & SPLIT PEA SOUP! I did a few things my old way such as simmered my ham bone for about an hour prior to starting the recipe.  I removed ham off of bone and used all the leftover ham that I had sliced from the previous ""baked ham"" dinner.  Instead of using chicken stock and water, I used the stock from the ham bone.  I added everything in the same order as Chef John, let simmer for a few hours and then added approx. 5 peeled, cubed potatos and 6 cut up carrots to the soup and let simmer another one to two hours longer.  I did simmer my soup on stovetop throughout the day for many hours (definitely stirring occasionaly).  My family from ages 9 - 55 LOVED LOVED this soup.  My husband stated that this was the ABSOLUTE BEST SPLIT PEA & HAM SOUP I have ever made.  Thank you for the added tips and directions on adding ingredients in a ""different way""!  WOW, who would have known that it would make such A MAJOR DIFFERENCE!!  I can&apos;t wait to go home after work to eat some more of this GREAT SOUP!  BTW, I always double my recipe for my BIG EATIN FAMILY!!  I did save some of my ham stock to add to the ""thickened"" soup if needed. My family LOVES my cooking, but stated that ""my"" recipes have become even GREATER since I found CHEF JOHN. LOVE YOU XOXOXOXO"
4,"Try this with the addition of Masoor Dal (red, split lentils). The lentils tend to disintegrate and give the soup a thickness that&apos;s quite appealing."
5,"I&apos;d give this soup 100 stars if I could!!  I found Chef John&apos;s recipe on Foodwishes.com and made it at least 5 times now.  Even when I double the recipe it doesn&apos;t hang around long enough for me to get my fill and I crave it until I make more.  Works well either on the stove top as stated, or in the crock pot (do step one as stated, then throw it all in the crock pot on low for about 8 hours).  Simply delicious!!"
5,"Amazing, I&apos;ve never made split pea soup. I added a little veg oil instead of butter. I did cook the diced onions and diced celery until it was translucent. I did add green onions as well. Then added left over ham from Thanksgiving from Logan Farms and also the Sausage from Bone Daddy&apos;s. I stirred for a few. Then added the split peas stirred it infor a couple of minutes before I added the Chicken Stock. I covered all with the chicken stock. Then a pinch of salt and pepper. Boiled it for 45 min. Stirred it continusly.  Then lowered temp to simmer the rest for an hour and 15mins. My husband couldnt get enough of it. Its was incredidble. Thank you"
5,"A Keeper! I enjoy split pea soup very much. I thought this was the best I&apos;ve ever had. My wife who is not a soup fan at all (any kind of soup) found this delicious. The flavors really were as Chef John described, the smokey salty ham flavor married with the slightly sweat pea flavor. I guess the key is the ""sweating"" of the onions, garlic and celery in the butter, because I&apos;ve made split pea soup many times and its never tasted nearly this good. I made a few minor alterations because of what I had on hand and because of what I needed to use up. I don&apos;t think these added or subtracted from the basic recipe, I&apos;m just listing them here fwiw: (1) I used 48 oz turkey stock (instead of chicken stock.) and about 8 oz of water. (2) Added 2 small russett potatoes diced small (left skin on) and (3) about 8 baby carrots sliced about 1/8 inch. I placed it all in the slow cooker (added the butter, onions, garlic, celery after ""sweating"" them on the stove in a pan) and 10 hours later, the most delicious split pea soup I&apos;ve ever eaten."
5,"Just made this for dinner, and it&apos;s a keeper (literally, too - it made a whole lot of soup! More than the 8 serving stated). I followed the recipe almost exactly, only changing up 2 things. I added 4 cooked and chopped slices of bacon that I had leftover from breaky, and I seasoned with a couple pinches of cumin because I think it adds a little something different. Great recipe!"
2,pretty bland. Needed to cook much longer than 1 hour 15 minutes for peas to be fully cooked.
5,"Oh my gosh! I need another stomach to hold all the soup I wish I could eat! I needed a split pea sou recipe that did not call for a ham hock or bone because I only had some ham frozen leftover... This is a great simple recipe that is so flexible. I had no bay leaves, and I prefer to use olive oil for sauteing... I also added two chopped carrots to the recipe. And just for kicks and giggles, I added about 3/4 cup pinot grigio in the last 30 minutes. It almost doesn&apos;t matter what you do to this recipe, as long as you have a pound of ham, a pound of peas, and some broth, you will be happy. If my stomach was not a finite vessel, I would have eaten the whole pot by now!"
5,declared delicious and the best pea soup i have made. added two carrots and more broth to thin soup before serving. yum!
5,"I will NEVER use another potato soup recipe , this ones perfect! We don&apos;t care for cooked celery so I use a little celery seed . I use this recipe as a base also, with many variations , such as... no meat at all , italian sausage & extra onion (my husband&apos;s favorite), diced chicken breast & (presteamed) broccoli (my kids&apos; favorite !)and coming soon ..garlic, chicken breast, baby carrots, frozen corn,green beans and coarsely chopped onion."
5,"This is the BEST potatoe soup I&apos;ve had!  A few changes I did... I didn&apos;t bother peeling the potatoes, just washed and diced them up.  Also added some chopped carrots for color and flavor.  Only added about 1/2tsp of pepper and no extra salt, just the boullion.  I like my potatoe soup a little bit thicker than it turned out.  I&apos;m not sure if I did something wrong with the flour mixture or if it&apos;s just a thinner broth.  So I mashed the veges real lightly with potatoe masher and added instant mashed potatoe flakes to thicken it up a bit!  Wonderful recipe!"
5,"This is one of the best ham & potato soups I&apos;ve ever tasted! I&apos;m always looking for ham recipes, as I often buy a half fully cooked ham, cube, and divide up into freezer bags for quick meals. Making the white sauce separately really added the right creaminess to the potato/ham & veggie mixture. I used a can of chicken broth for part of the liquid, as I didn&apos;t have any bullion. Also threw in some shredded carrots I had on hand, plus 1/2 cup shredded cheese to the white sauce after it had thickened. Also, (to disguise the carrots), added a sprinkle of cheese to each bowl upon serving. Very creamy and tasty. I&apos;ll definitely make again, possibly adding corn next time."
5,I thought this recipe was excellent.  I did change it a little bit.  I used a ham bone with a little meat left on it.  I boiled it to make stock and used this in place of the water.  Then stripped the meat off the bone to use in the soup.  I also put a few sprigs of fresh thyme in it...the result was soooo good.  I made it for a friend who was sick and my husband was begging me to get them a pizza and let us have the soup!  This is going in my recipe box for good!
4,"My dad gave me this huge ham last week and I have been looking for any recipe that has ham in it.  I tried this one yesterday and converted it to a crockpot recipe.  I LOVE my crockpot and use it constantly!  I sauted the onions in a little vegetable oil until soft, added all the ingredients except the butter/flour and milk to the crockpot and cooked all day until the potatoes were nice and soft.  I also added one diced carrot.  About an hour before dinner I made the rue with the flour and butter and used a 12 oz. and 5 oz. can of evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I don&apos;t like to use regular milk in crockpot recipes because it sometimes curdles on me.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder to the soup, it just seemed like it needed a little something when I tasted it before serving.  Topped each bowl of soup with fresh ground pepper and sliced green onions.  This soup is rich, thick and creamy.  Very hearty and filling, perfect for a cold winter night meal!  My family really enjoyed this served with a homemade cheesy garlic pizza."
5,"Lots of chopping to do, but it was wonderful!! I also added fresh green beans and a can of chicken broth (instead of the water). I put it in the slower cooker on low for 6 hours and it was perfect!!"
5,"I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  When there was a death in the family, I needed something to take FAST so that we could get on the road.  Very risky to bring something as a gift for a whole family, especially if you have never tested the recipe, but this was a home run!  The ham really made this special and oh so good.  I used far less salt, didn&apos;t measure, just to taste.  Since different hams have different salt content, I highly recommend tasting first.  Also, I used a little over 1 TBSP of boullion because I wanted the great taste of ham to come through.  I cooked this on the stove and then put in my crockpot to keep warm and make travelling and reheating easy.  Perfect!  Thanks for such a great recipe!"
5,"OMG, I received this recipe today as the ""Daily Dish"" and it has already become a favorite!  We could NOT stop eating this soup, just amazing.  The only changes I made was to add a few extra cups of chicken broth in addition to the water and boullion because I think I went a little overboard on the potatoes and needed more liquid.  I also found that turning the heat up to med-high while stirring the butter, flour and milk mixture helped it to thicken more quickly.  I added some cheddar cheese while stirring the sauce and then topped the bowls with a little more.  Thanks for an easy and absolutely scrumtious recipe, my husband will be asking for this often!"
5,"This soup was DELICIOUS!  My picky eater kids even asked for seconds and thirds.  My husband who is not a soup fan loved it and asked me to put it on our list of regular meals. The only changes I made to the recipe was by using one can of Chicken Broth instead of the water and buillion cubes.  My only suggestion is to double or triple the recipe, because you are going to want more than one bowl!"
3,"one teaspoon of pepper in this recipe is way too much for my taste.  I wish I would have used a more conservative approach with the pepper because it overpowered everything.  Anyway, I made the recipe ""as is"" and tasted it.  Then I decided to add extra ham and some cheese for additional flavor.  I used 8 oz of colby jack cheese, but think that an extra sharp cheddar would have been much better.  I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll make this again."
5,"Hi everyone this is my recipe! Thanks for all the great reviews however they have made a misprint in the submission.  It should read 3 large cans of whole tomatoes, crushed by hand NOT 3 tomatoes, that would make this very spicy as well as very thick.  I don&apos;t remember if I wrote this part as well, but I usually drain the 2 cans of beans, and I leave the liquid of the rem. cans. Luckily not many have been effected by the mistake.  thanks again."
5,"Excellent chili. 
                                
                                Just a note to cooks who are worried about sodium intake. In response to previous posters, the liquid beans are canned in is very high in sodium. Canned beans should always be drained and rinsed for a healthier meal."
2,"I understand that this says ""spicy"" in the description, but I think that&apos;s an understatement. I found this to be WAY too spicy. I think that the spiciness overshadowed the other flavors. I served this to my family and no one was able to make it past 1/5 of the bowl, including myself, because it was just too spicy. It would be good if you cut out 90% of the chili powder & used 1 or less Jalapeno."
5,"I LOVED this recipe!  I did find however that I had to almost double the amount of chili powder and cumin.  Just kind of taste and add till you get it where you really love it.  I used Original Boca Burgers that I broke up into little pieces, and like so many other reviewers, no one could tell it wasn&apos;t meat! It is, however, very important to break the Boca Burgers up into tiny pieces, otherwise, if you leave big chunks I think you can taste a little difference.  This does make a huge amount.  I think it would easily feed 10 or 12....especially if you were to put it over rice and serve with maybe some grated cheddar, sour cream and chopped avacados.....chopped onions would be good too!!"
5,"This is a great recipe. I added 1 zuchini, 1 red bell pepper, 1 can pinto beans, 1 bag of frozen corn (we like it better than canned), and 1 can tomato paste (I drained my beans and added water; plus I like a tomato based chili). I also added a few splashes of tobasco sauce, I think my chili powder must have been milder than others because we did not have enough spice. I reccommend using the whole stewed tomatoes because they have a thicker consistency. You can use your kitchen scissors and cut them up while they are still in the can. I think I will add a can of white beans next time. There really is a lot of the veggie meat and I like a fair amount of beans. I froze the chili in individual containers and made corn bread muffins and froze those too. We were able to have several chili/muffin lunches.
                                Thanks for the great recipe Cal :)"
5,"I was a little confused - ground oregano or leaf? (I ended up using the latter, because I had more of it.) Couldn&apos;t much drain the chile peppers, and I wondered whether to drain the beans (don&apos;t). 
                                
                                Turned out very well, beautiful, though I might use a little less chili powder next time (and I used a skimpy 1/4 cup). Also used only 1 jalepeno - it was plenty spicy tonight, and will be spicier tomorrow. I used about a teaspoon of salt instead of a tablespoon and it was enough.
                                
                                Modifying review to add my experience cooking it in a slow cooker... I prepared the veggies (onion, garlic, green pepper, celery) as instructed, and then transferred them to the slow cooker before throwing in the rest of the ingredients except for the corn. I cooked on high for a couple hours and added the corn about an hour before the end and turned my cooker down to low at the same time (about 3 hours in the slow cooker in all). It turned out brilliantly. I was worried the veggie crumbles might get rubbery, but they did not, and the spices were mellower but still very tasty. Huge hit at the office, even though they are all meateaters."
5,"This recipe tempts me to never buy canned chili again! My whole family enjoyed this one and the leftovers have proved tastier than the first bowl.  I did make a few adjustments.  I used only one jalapeno and added salt to taste rather than the entire tablespoon all at once.  I&apos;d guess I used about half a tablespoon.  I used canned crushed tomatoes in place of the fresh ones (a 28 oz can I think) and added an extra can of beans since I had some on hand.  I cheated and used ground turkey in place of the veggie crumbles and I let the whole thing sit on the burner over low heat for about two hours instead of the 45 mins.  The result was amazing!  This is awesome chili, I can&apos;t wait to make it again...thanks!"
5,"What great chili for a snowy day in Wisconsin!  Loved this a lot. Made as is except drained and rinsed all the beans to make them less salty and then added a bit of water. Thanks for sharing this yummy, healthy recipe."
5,went almost totally by the recipe...except used about 1 1/2 packages of the crumbles instead of 2 and i let simmer for @ 2 hours...THE BEST VEGGIE CHILI EVER...THANKS...by the way this makes a HUGE POT...but youll be happy to have the left overs as it does get better by the day
5,"If there was a section for Comments, I would leave this message there because this is for the reviewer that gave it one star and commented that it was not really goulash.  Well, it may not be goulash to you but there are thousands of us who grew up eating this and it was called goulash.  It is an easy, filling, economical, tasty dish so keep your reviews to the recipe and not the name, you may not know what you are talking about.  I noticed you did the same thing to a mexican dish;  you said it was not authentic.  This is a site to share recipes and report how it worked for us."
4,"This is the classic goulash made in the mid-west, USA, not Hungarian Goulash. I grew up on this in Iowa, but we used Worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce, no bay leaf, and a green pepper if we had one."
5,"This is not ""classic"" Hungarian Goulash but it is goulash or Chop Suey depending on what part of the country you grew up. For me it was western NY and we added canned corn. Made this tonight, exactly as written, for my very picky folks and we loved it; it was a taste of my childhood. Next time I&apos;ll add Jalapeno and bell peppers."
5,"This one is classic AMERICAN style goulash.  The picture depicts it.  This is a dish that was mainstay for most of us and even served at school.   @Pathunt:  Nicely done!  I made it just as the recipe states and enjoyed it but next time around I will add a diced green pepper to the meat as it&apos;s browning and probably a shake of garlic powder to remind me of school, and LOTS of fresh ground pepper."
4,"I&apos;m grateful for this recipe because it reminds me of a dish my mother made in the mid-1940&apos;s in Denmark after the war when we finally could get enough cheap meat with our ration coupons to do it.  This recipe has nothing whatever to do with anything I think of as goulash, whether Hungarian, Austrian, German or even Danish, but it was a way to use ground meat for something other than meat balls.  My mother&apos;s concoction was called Red Indian Hash because of the colors added by vegetables (nothing to do with Native Americans either!), and everybody loved it, served not with macaroni in it, but with mashed potatoes on the side to absorb the lovely gravy.  She grated carrots and turnips and any other root vegetable she had and cooked them along with the chopped onions. She might add a few beans or peas as well. Any ground meat was fine - beef, veal, pork, mutton - whatever we were lucky enough to have.  Canned tomatoes did not exist then, so she had to moisten the mix with stock (usually vegetable stock with an addition of yeast extract - no soy sauce then) and chop a tomato or two if she could spare them.  With everything available to us now, just think what we could do with a pound of ground meat, matching veggie flavors and herbs and aromatics to the type of meat.  Thanks for reminding me of what can be done! and of how rich we are now. . ."
4,"Because we&apos;re on a super tight budget this week, I used only one pound ground meat (half ground beef, half ground pork) and threw in chopped veggies for the rest of the meat (red pepper, zucchini, spinach). To make a more tomato-y sauce, I used V-8 instead of water. I&apos;m out of soy sauce so I used worchestershire instead of soy sauce. I did not need the seasoning salt--we&apos;re watching our salt intake--and I also used organic canned tomato sauce, organic canned tomatoes and homemade italian seasoning. Very economical and a good way for me to bend the recipe to add more healthy ingredients for my family nevermind it filled the bellies of my three hungry men very well. There&apos;s plenty leftover for lunch tomorrow as well, which I appreciate."
5,"This is delicious! It is near identical to a Paula Deen goulash recipe that I have been making for a few years. It is also easy to make as the noodles are added uncooked. The main difference it appears between this and that recipe of hers, that I use, is it looks like the ingredients here are doubled, so this recipe here will feed a lot! And, this recipe here uses tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and that one uses an equal amount of crushed tomatoes. Either way, Mid-western style goulash is a favorite in my home!"
5,"Being from Minnesota, I understood the term ""goulash"" as meaning ""hot dish"" as the two terms are more or less interchangable in this state! I realize there is a Hungarian goulash which is completely different, but this is a regional term that I understood to be exactly what it is! Kudos! Yummy"
5,"mrsjoedo mentioned something was missing, next time try adding chopped green pepper. To me it&apos;s not goulash unless you add it."
3,"Too soupy, too much bay. Was ok but wont make again."
